Operator
Welcome to the quarterly earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today's conference. [Operator instructions] I would like to inform all parties that today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rich Kinder, executive chairman of Kinder Morgan. Thank you. You may begin.
Rich Kinder -- Executive Chairman
Thank you, Sheila. Before we begin, as usual, I'd like to remind you that KMI's earnings release today and this call includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. Before making any investment decisions, we strongly encourage you to read our full disclosures on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release, as well as review our latest filings with the SEC, for important material assumptions, expectations, and risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in such forward-looking statements. As we look at our financial outlook for 2024, we are projecting very healthy growth in EBITDA, EPS, and DCF per share.
While there are always headwinds and tailwinds for a company as sizable as Kinder Morgan, it appears that our strategy of expanding our assets through expansion, capex, and acquisitions, primarily in our natural gas segment, is delivering real benefits to the bottom line. Kim and the management team will be taking you through our '24 budget in great detail at the investor conference next week. In my remarks on these calls over the last few quarters, I've tried to outline the tremendous growth that we and most energy experts expect in natural gas production and demand over the coming years, driven primarily by LNG exports and exports to Mexico. To the obvious relief of all of you on this call, I won't be repeating the details supporting our outlook, but that growth is leading to extensive opportunities to grow our system, which already delivers about 40% of the nation's natural gas throughput. Through selective expansion and extension of our enormous system, we can benefit from this expansion.

Thankfully, most of these opportunities are concentrated along the Gulf Coast, where permitting and construction usually moves more quickly than elsewhere. Let me conclude with a bit of humor. Someone recently said in comparing our growth to that of high-tech companies that we were like the tortoise in Aesop's fable compared to the hare represented by high tech. Now, that's probably true, but I like to think that looking at 2024, the tortoise is moving a little faster, and then I would remind you of who won that race in the end. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim.
Kim Dang -- President
Thanks, Rich. I'll make a few overall points and then turn it over to Tom and David to give you the details. We ended 2023 slightly below budget, is about 1% on DCF per share and about 2% on EBITDA. There are several different moving pieces, but more than all of it can be attributed to lower commodity prices.
Just before year-end, we closed the roughly $1.8 billion NextEra South Texas acquisition. This asset -- these assets fit nicely into our existing Texas system serving the Gulf Coast and Mexico demand market. We were excited to be able to get that transaction done a little more quickly than we expected. Looking forward to 2024, as Rich said, we expect really nice growth over '23 with every business unit expected to contribute incremental earnings.
We've updated the preliminary budget guidance we released in early December of last year to incorporate the South Texas acquisition. As a result, our final 2024 budget now projects 15% growth in earnings per share versus 2023 and 8% growth in DCF per share. Our commodity assumptions in the final budget are unchanged versus the preliminary budget. We assume WTI of $82 a barrel and $3.50 for Henry Hub Natural Gas, which was consistent with the forward curve during our annual budget process. While current prices are lower, we did not update prices in our final guidance given their potential to change over the year.
However, based on our commodity sensitivities, even at current prices, we would still expect strong growth over 2023 given our relatively -- relatively modest commodity closure. For example, at a WTI price of $72 per barrel and Henry Hub of $2.80, earnings per share would grow at 12% versus '23 and DCF per share would grow at 6%. During the fourth quarter, we put $965 million of projects in service and added 344 million to the backlog, which currently stands at approximately $3 billion. Despite the decline versus last quarter, we're still confident in our ability to spend at the high end of the $1 billion to $2 billion per year discretionary capex range for the next few years.
Our confidence is supported by the roughly 20% expected growth in the natural gas market between now and 2030 driven by LNG exports, exports to Mexico, and industrial demand. We're looking at multiple expansion projects, some of them significant in size to supply LNG exports from Texas -- from the Texas coast, the Louisiana coast, and the West Coast to supply Mexico through exports from both Texas and Arizona to bring incremental supply to the southeast markets for Permian egress, as well as expansions of storage and for incremental power and industrial demand. We're in a strong position as we exit 2023 and move into 2024. Our balance sheet is the strongest it has been in about a decade. We're projecting nice growth for 2024.
And the natural gas business, which is greater than 60% of KMI's EBDA, is underpinned by 20% growth in that market, leading to nice expansion opportunities. We will continue to return significant capital to our investors through dividends and opportunistic share repurchase. Next week at our annual investor conference, we will review in much more detail our '24 budget, industry fundamentals, and our future opportunity set and answer all your questions. And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom to give you details on the performance for the quarter.
Tom Martin -- President, CO2 and Energy Transition Ventures
Thanks, Kim. Starting with the natural gas business unit, transport volumes increased by 5%, or 1.9 million decatherms per day, for the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2022 driven primarily from EPNG's Line 2000 return to service and the Texas intrastate increased LNG feed gas demand and increased power demand. These increases were partially offset by decreased deliveries to local distribution companies. Our natural gas gathering volumes were up 27% in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of '22, driven by Haynesville volumes which were up 59%; Bakken volumes which were up 14%; and Eagle Ford volumes up 18%.
Gathering volumes grew 14% compared to Q3 2023. For the full year, gathering volumes are up nicely at 19% over 2022 and just slightly below our 2023 plan. We continue to see high demand for and utilization of our natural gas assets, which is driving, in many instances, longer-term contracts, higher rates, and increased project opportunities in a growing U.S. market.
In our products pipeline segment, refined product volumes were up slightly about 1% for the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by an increase in jet fuel, partially offset by a slight reduction in diesel volumes. Gasoline volumes were flat for the comparable quarter last year. We continue to see a considerable ramp in renewable diesel volumes slowing in our pipeline serving California. The pipeline volumes from the RD hub projects we placed into service earlier this year have grown from 700 a day in Q1 to 27,000 a day in Q4, and we're currently expecting well above 30,000 a day in January. As we stated previously, these RD hub projects are largely underpinned with take-or-pay contracts associated with our terminals' facilities, so we get paid most of our revenue even if those volumes do not flow.
However, when RD volumes actually flow on our pipelines, we collect the additional tariff on those barrels as well. Crude and condensate volumes were up 7% in the quarter versus fourth quarter 2022, driven by higher Hiland wellhead volumes and favorable Double H transportation fundamentals from the Bakken. In our terminals business segment, our liquids lease capacity remains high at 93%. Excluding tanks out of service for required inspections, approximately 97% of our capacity is leased. Utilization at our key hubs in the east and Ship Channel in New York Harbor strengthened in the quarter versus fourth quarter 2022.
We continue to see nice rate increases in those markets, and leasing remains near all-time record levels. Our Jones Act tankers are 100% leased through 2024, assuming likely options are exercised. On the bulk side, overall volumes were up 3% from the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily from metals, petcoke, and soda ash tonnage, partially offset by decrease -- decreases in grain and aggregate volumes. Grain volumes are minimal -- have minimal impact on our financial results.
Excluding grain, bulk volumes were up 5%. The CO2 segment experienced lower overall volumes on NGL, CO2, and oil production and lower prices on NGLs and CO2 versus the fourth quarter 2022. Overall oil production decreased by 7% from the fourth quarter last year but was above our plan for this quarter. For the year, net oil volume slightly exceeded our plan largely due to better-than-expected performance from projects at Yates and SACROC, as well as strong base volumes post the February outages at SACROC.
These favorable volumes relative to the 2023 plan helped offset some of the price weaknesses that we have experienced. With that, I'll turn it over to David Michels.
David Michels -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Tom. So, for the fourth quarter of 2023, we're declaring a dividend of $0.2825 per share or $1.13 per share annualized, which is 2% up from the 2022 dividend. We continued with our opportunistic share repurchase program in the fourth quarter, bringing our total year-to-date repurchases to over 31 million shares at an average price of $16.56 per share, creating a good value for our shareholders. We ended 2023 with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 4.2 times, and that includes $522 million of repurchased shares and the $1.8 billion closing of our acquisition of the South Texas midstream assets before year-end.
Our -- our leverage would have been 4.1 times if we had included a full-year adjusted EBITDA contribution from those acquired assets. We ended 2023 just slightly below budget for the full year, and more than all of that underperformance can be explained by lower-than-budgeted commodity prices. We saw better than budgeted performance in both our natural gas and terminals businesses. Now, for the quarterly performance, we generated revenues of $4 billion, which was down $541 million from the fourth quarter of 2022.
Cost of sales were down a bit more than that at a reduction of 614 million. Both of those declines were due to a decline in commodity price year over year. As you'll recall, we enter offsetting purchase and sales positions in our Texas intrastate business, which is primarily why our revenue and cost of sales are exposed to price fluctuations but our margin is generally not impacted by price. Interest expense was higher versus 2022, as expected, driven by short-term interest rates impacting our floating rate interest swaps. We generated net income attributable to KMI of $594 million, down 11% from the fourth quarter of 2022.
Our EPS was $0.27, down $0.03 from 2022. Our average share counts reduced by 27 million shares, or 1%, due to the repurchased shares. For a business segment performance, terminals and products segments were up, natural gas and CO2 segments were down, versus the fourth quarter of 2022. The natural gas segment was down mostly due to mild winter weather in 2023 versus 2022.
The product pipeline segment was up due to higher rates on existing assets, as well as contributions from new expansion projects including our renewable diesel assets. Terminals was up due to improved rates on our Jones Act business, contractual rate escalations across multiple assets, and improved tank lease rates in the northeast region. Our CO2 segment was down due to lower oil and CO2 volumes. Our DCF per share was $0.52, down $0.02 from last year. Excluding interest expense, we were favorable last year.
For the balance sheet, we ended the year with $31.8 billion of net debt, which was an increase from year-end of $901 million -- year-end 2022, that is. So, a high-level reconciliation for the year to date or the full year 2023. Change in net debt is as follows: We generated $6.5 billion of cash flow from operations; we spent $2.5 billion in dividends; we spent $2.5 billion of total capex that includes our growth sustaining and contributions to JVs; we repurchased -- we repurchased $500 million of stock; and we spent $1.8 billion on the South Texas midstream acquisition, which gets you close to the $901 million increase in net debt for the year. As Kim mentioned, we updated our 2024 budget for the South Texas acquisition from the December guidance that we released.
As you can see, the acquisition was quite accretive on both the EPS and DCF per share. We're very pleased with the resulting growth projected for 2024 with EPS growth of 15%, DCF per share and EBITDA growth of 8%, and a nice improvement in our leverage ratio to 3.9 times by year-end 2024. And as Rich said, we'll be providing all the details behind those at our annual Investor Day meeting one week from today. With that, back to Kim.
Kim Dang -- President
OK, Sheila, we'd like now to open it up for questions. We would request that those asking questions, if you'd please limit it to one question and one follow-up. And if you have additional questions, please get back in the queue. And we will stay here until we get to everyone.
Questions & Answers:

Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan.
Your line is open.
Jeremy Tonet -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Hi, good afternoon.
Kim Dang -- President
Good afternoon, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Maybe just starting off here, wanted to start off with the recent weather. It's been a cold snap that we've seen across a lot of the country, in Texas as well. And last time we saw a cold snap with Uri, it led to notable opportunities for -- for the midstream and KMI. And, well, it's probably not the same order of magnitude here by any means but just wondering if you could shed any color on if you are seeing kind of increased opportunities in this environment, or how we should think about that in general?
Kim Dang -- President
Sure, Jeremy. Yeah, I mean, the cold weather, you're right, does lead to incremental opportunities for us. You're also right that this is not the same order of magnitude as -- as -- a Uri. You know, when we do our budget, we do budget for -- for some cold weather.
And I think, you know, coming into the year, we were a little bit nervous about that given the -- the – the -- a warmer-than-expected weather. With this cold front, I think we have made good progress on -- on achieving on -- on our way to achieving some of those cold weather budget assumptions. So, I'm very happy with the progress today.
Jeremy Tonet -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Got it. That's helpful there. Thanks. And then, just wanted to come back to capital allocation as maybe we talked about in the past and we've seen Kinder execute on repurchases this year and also some sizable M&A.
And just wondering, on a go-forward basis here, if you could walk us through, I guess, how those two specific opportunities could stack up in your mind. Clearly, there's still room on the kind of balance sheet given leverage targets and where leverage sits today, and just wondering how those two stack up. And as it relates to buybacks, is there a certain kind of cap and pace, or any other thoughts that we should think about there?
Kim Dang -- President
No, I mean I think we -- we like the flexibility that we've -- that we have on our balance sheet. You know, we've been around four a time. At -- for the last three years, I think in the '21, we were at 3.9. Last year, we were at 4.1, and right now, we're at 4.2.
But if you adjusted for the EBITDA on the acquisition, you'd be -- you'd be at 4.1. And so, that gives us flexibility to do acquisitions. That gives us flexibility to do share repurchases. And so, you know, last year, we were able to do share repurchase. We did 522 million.
As you heard David say, we made a $1.8 billion acquisition, and our balance sheet ended, you know, essentially in the same place that we started the year. So, you know, when -- especially when we're doing attractive acquisitions, you know, it's not that dilutive to our debt metric. And so, you know, we -- we acquired the next acquisition at about 8.6 times. And so, you know, relative to our debt metric, even though we are 100% debt funded, it wasn't that dilutive.
So, I think where our balance sheet is gives us lots of flexibility, and we were able to execute on multiple opportunistic transactions during -- during 2023. And that's, quite frankly, what we would look to do going forward as well.
Jeremy Tonet -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Got it. Makes sense. See you at the Analyst Day. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Next, we will hear from Brian Reynolds with UBS. You may proceed.
Kim Dang -- President
Hey, Brian.
Brian Reynolds -- UBS -- Analyst
Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Maybe to start off on just the quarterly performance and the '24 guidance, kind of as it relates specifically to the natural gas segment, you know, Jeremy touched on it a little bit, but we saw the year-over-year decline in that gas segment, you know, driven by some winter storms in 4Q '22. But it'd be great if you could just refresh us on -- on maybe some of the marketing exposure in the business. You know, previously, we kind of view it as -- as mostly contracted at this point, but just given the year-over-year earnings decline and maybe looking forward, just given, you know, a significant amount of net gas price volatility expected ahead and Kinder's strategic positioning in natural gas storage, just kind of curious of how we should think about maybe the marketing side of this business on a go-forward basis versus kind of over the last five years. Thanks.
Kim Dang -- President
Well, let's start on the -- the interstate transmission side. And so, you know, when you have a winter storm, you know, people are going to need more balancing services, they're going to need more storage services, you're going to have more usage, but you -- because you have more molecules flowing. And so, what happens around a lot of times these winter storms is we're providing ancillary services to our customers that they need and they want in order to serve their customers. So -- and so, you see some incremental business on the interstate side and around those services. On the intrastate side, there, we actually -- we do hold some storage in our own name, and then, our customers have storage as well.
So, we make money from time to time on the small amount of storage that we do hold in our own name. We also have a little bit of transport capacity that we hold in our own name. It's not significant overall but we can make money on that where we haven't already hedged it. And then, some of the same types of services that -- that the interstate customers need, the intrastate customers also need. So, you know, they will over-pull on our system above their rights, and those -- those services come at premium rates.
And so, those are the types of things that you see when we have winter weather that leads to some incremental margin on the margin.
Brian Reynolds -- UBS -- Analyst
Great, thanks. Appreciate that. Maybe as a follow-up to -- to pivot to the Permian natural gas egress, looking forward, you know, seem to be -- appear to be short natural gas in the Agua Dulce market going forward with LNG demand coming online in the back half of the decade. So, kind of just curious if you could talk about, you know, potential new projects including GCX expansion, what are the updates there, and/or the potential for a new build longer term.
Thanks.
Kim Dang -- President
Sure, I can talk about both of those, and then I'll ask people to add. And so, yes, we think there is going to be a need for further Permian egress in the back half of the decade. I think that's consistent with the -- with what we have been saying. We think we are well positioned for that.
You know, we've got -- we've built multiple pipelines successfully. They've been generally very close to -- to being on time. We also have an existing system that we can interconnect with, and so we can offer the shippers on a Permian egress pipeline, you know, storage services and other downstream services that I think some of our competitors can't. So, I think it's -- it's a project we're very interested in, but we will be disciplined in -- in how we approach it and make sure that the returns are attractive to our shareholders. You know, I think GCX -- you know, some of the same dynamics around GCX.
GCX, obviously because it's a compression expansion of an existing system, we get to market with it -- with it much quicker. We've continued to have conversations with shippers on that capacity. Not quite there yet. But, you know, some of -- I mean, if we did one -- if we participated in the newbuild on the GCX expansion, there also could be further downstream expansions of our existing system. And so, that's something that we're also looking at as -- as part of this.
Brian Reynolds -- UBS -- Analyst
Great. Makes sense. I'll leave it there. See you next week.
Kim Dang -- President
[Inaudible] follow-up.
Tom Martin -- President, CO2 and Energy Transition Ventures
Yeah, Brian, just I'll follow-up there just so you get a little sense. You know, when we think about the need for the capacity, you know, we say back half of the decade, but what we're hearing from our customers is probably late '26, early '27. So, you know, clearly, we're in a competitive environment here. So, I won't go through a lot of details, but you know, something probably needs to be actioned here in the next couple of quarters to be able to meet that timeline. And the question is really is it just one pipe or two when you think about the incremental demand that's coming on.
Brian Reynolds -- UBS -- Analyst
Great. Makes sense. I appreciate that extra color. Have a great rest of your day.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Jean Salisbury -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst
Hi. There's a lot of differing reports around Haynesville production trajectory and whether it's in decline and kind of has been in decline for a couple of months. It seems like your fourth quarter was up quite a lot from your third quarter Haynesville volumes, but I was wondering if you could just talk about what you've been seeing on your acreage there the last month or two, I guess, toward the end of the fourth quarter.
Kim Dang -- President
Yeah, so if you look at our Haynesville volumes, they were, I think, and Tom didn't say this, but in the 14% quarter over quarter. Haynesville was up over 30%. So, we've continued to see increase in our -- in our Haynesville volumes. And so, over to you, Tom.
Tom Martin -- President, CO2 and Energy Transition Ventures
Yeah, I mean, so look, the team's done a wonderful job with our acreage. You know, we're -- we're -- our acreage is positioned in prime tier 1 acreage. You know, our largest customer there is planning for the upcoming LNG wave. And so, you know, while we have seen some of the smaller producers kind of pull back, I think everyone is getting ready for the upcoming demand that's coming our way. And so, you know, if you ask me, I think some of the pullback has helped us.
We've had a little bit -- you know, we're trying to keep up with the demand in terms of physical capacity. And so, this year, hopefully, we'll get the rest of that capacity on and be primed and ready to support our customers when they're ready to take. So, it's been a -- it's a pretty good ride. We've -- we've pretty much doubled our volumes over the last couple of years.
Jean Salisbury -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst
Great. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, as a follow-up, do you see any risks this year that gas infrastructure out of the Bakken might limit your growth out of that basin this year?
Tom Martin -- President, CO2 and Energy Transition Ventures
Well, no. I think -- look, I think we've got -- you know, I think we talked about this at the last quarter, we had our -- you know, we have two projects that we're looking at bringing incremental gas out of the Bakken, one, which was -- we just put into service this past November. We call it our Bakken Express. And we had a phase 1 and a phase 2. That first wave is already in service and flowing full 92,000 a day coming into the Cheyenne hub out of the Bakken.
So, we don't think gas will be the limiting factor anymore, especially once we get the second phase out. I think we're in pretty good shape there.
Jean Salisbury -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst
Great. That's all for me. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
John Mackay -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Hey, all. Thanks for the time. I'm -- I'm going to start on a pretty simplistic one. I might have a straightforward answer, but just in terms of the 2024 guidance increase going from 8.0 to 8.16, is that -- is that all on STX? Is there any other change in there that you can frame up? And maybe just how do we think about that increase versus kind of what you were guiding for the EBITDA on those assets this year?
Kim Dang -- President
The -- the 8.0, when we published it, was slightly below 8.0, but it rounded up to 8.0. And so -- and then, the 8.16, the only difference between those two numbers is the EBITDA on NextEra. And the EBITDA for NextEra for 2024 is consistent with what we were expecting.
John Mackay -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
OK, that's -- that is clear then. Thanks for that. And then, maybe just shifting gears, talk about RNG contributions in the quarter a little bit, kind of where that ended up trending for the year, how much of the kind of '23 softness versus budget was driven by that, and how much could bounce back in '24.
Kim Dang -- President
Yeah, I mean I would say that the contribution from the RNG plants in the fourth quarter was relatively small. And, you know, we do have three plants in service now. They're not running as consistently as we would like them to run. And so, I think -- I think that's what we're focused on now. We recently took over operations from waste management, and we think that, you know, once we really get our arms around this, we will be able to -- to run these -- get these to run very consistently.
You know, that may take a couple of months into 2024, but we think we'll get them running consistently.
John Mackay -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
All right, appreciate that. Thank you. See you next week.
Operator
Next, we will hear from Tristan Richardson with Scotiabank. You may proceed.
Tristan Richardson -- Scotiabank -- Analyst
Hey, good evening, guys. Just maybe a question on the STX. Can you talk a little bit about what's driving the growth in '24 versus '23? And then, with respect to integration of those assets, are there obvious sort of near-term low-hanging fruit-type of projects as part of the integration that could drive further or even sort of similar type of growth in '25 and beyond?
Kim Dang -- President
Sure. So, between '23 and '24, there is an expansion project -- contracted expansion project that came online. It came online late last -- late -- very late last year. And so, that -- that incremental EBITDA between '23 and '24 is locked in with -- with customer contracts.
You know, with respect to '24 and '25, you know, we don't see anything as significant as that driving the growth. You know, we talked about longer-term multiple being between 7 and 7.5 coming down from the 8.6 times that we bought it. And that was driven a lot by -- a small amount by some cost savings but really by some commercial synergies and some incremental business that -- that we think we can bring to those pipes. But that really occurred three to four years out.
Tristan Richardson -- Scotiabank -- Analyst
Appreciate the color, Kim. And then, maybe just following on a previous question around leverage, I mean, could you talk a little bit about where you sort of see the high end of where you're comfortable should something sizable, whether it be M&A or organic, you know, come across where you see yourself sort of the high end in terms of comfortable and leverage?
Kim Dang -- President
Yeah. So, you know, our leverage targets are 4.5 times, and there's no change in that. And so, you know, I think we feel like that's appropriate, you know, given the size, scope of our assets, the stability of our contracts that are underpinned by take-or-pay contracts with good customer credit quality. So, we've run, as I said earlier, around four times at the end of the last three years, and we see value in having some cushion for, you know -- for opportunities and/or risks if they -- if they should arise. And so, that gives us plenty of capacity to execute on some opportunity if we found it attractive. Now, this is burning a hole in our pocket.
You know, we don't have to go out and spend this money today. I mean, you've seen us, as I talked earlier, acquire those NextEra assets, not much impact to our debt to EBITDA multiple. We've purchased 500 million shares, not much impact. And so, we've been able to do a lot of these things without huge impacts, but we've got a lot of capacity there if we find something that is a good strategic fit, you know, and that's -- that has attractive economics for our shareholders.
Tristan Richardson -- Scotiabank -- Analyst
That's helpful. Appreciate it, Kim. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question will come from Neal Dingmann with Truist. Your line is open.
Unknown speaker
Hi, guys. Thanks for the time here. This is JP Basham for Neal. I had one clarification question, just kind of, you know, what we were talking about earlier.
The -- the -- the Permian nat gas egress that we're -- that you guys were referring to, the 2026 -- I guess late '26, '27, you know, what you've been hearing from customers, has that -- has that changed at all? I guess, you know, maybe some last quarter or two quarters ago, has the tone changed from customers, though, or is that, you know, kind of been the expectation for some time there?
Tom Martin -- President, CO2 and Energy Transition Ventures
Yeah, I don't think it's changed much. I think it's been the expectation. I think, you know, as the market -- you know, both the market side is coming together from the LNG standpoint, and the producing side, I think it's probably a perfect match in terms of timing. But I do -- I do sense that there is more of a need to -- to ensure that there's a solution in place, probably a little more urgent than maybe we had on the last couple of calls.
Unknown speaker
Sure, sure, got it. Thank you. And then, yeah, just one follow-up for me. The -- you know, the RD, you know, projects that you guys have anchored here, I was just -- you know, just going through the release, you know, and you guys note that you have potential capacity to expand in subsequent phases, I guess, in California. Do you mind elaborating on that, I guess, to the extent that you guys can? I guess what -- what would timing look like there? And I guess, you know, what level of capacity, you know, could we expect to see ramping in that time frame?
Dax Sanders -- Executive Vice President, Chief Strategy Officer
Yeah, this is Dax. You know, good question. I would just -- just to reiterate kind of what we've got now. Between the two hubs, we've got about 60,000 barrels a day just under capacity.
And then, in Los Angeles Harbor, our Carson terminal, we've got 750,000 barrels of storage that'll be fully in by -- by the end of the year, 20,000 barrels a day of rack throughput. In Los Angeles Harbor, I think we could easily double that, double the storage, as well as the through -- the rack throughput capacity. On the hubs, we can double those as well. If we did off the 60,000, that would get us up to a rate -- a throughput rate that would be somewhat consistent with what we've historically supplied in the state of California, you know, call it roughly around 120,000 now.
California uses about 250,000 barrels a day in diesel. And so, you know, theoretically, I think we could, you know, convert even -- even above that because I think we'll see -- you know, we've got our first facility now, Bradshaw, which is just outside of Sacramento, which we've converted 100% to -- to renewable diesel -- no hydrocarbon diesel going through there. So, you know -- but whether we do that, it will all be, you know, determined by -- by the market. I mean we'll be, you know, continuously engaged with our customers and, you know, watching the ramp-up of these two Northern California refineries. And, you know, we'll do whatever -- whatever our customers want us to do.

Perfect. Thank you very much, guys. Appreciate it.

Our next question comes from Neel Mitra with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Neel Mitra -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering what volume assumptions you're using on the gas side for the STX acquisition in the Eagle Ford and maybe just the dynamics that you're seeing there with GOR ratios and activity.
Kim Dang -- President
Yeah, hey, Neel, on -- with respect to the 2024 budget assumptions, we're going to go through all of those at the conference next week. So, if you can hold your question, and we'll make sure we address it next week at the investor conference when we go through the '24 budget in -- in detail.
Neel Mitra -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
OK, fair enough. And then, maybe asking the same question a different way. All else equal, if you don't make an acquisition, you're trending toward, I guess, 3.8 times leverage in '24. Do you see value in lowering the leverage ratio and staying under four times, or do you -- do you still see kind of 4.5 times is the proper leverage ratio given your asset base?
Kim Dang -- President
Yeah, I think we're comfortable with 4.5 times, as I said earlier, given, you know, the size, scope -- size and scope of our assets and the stability of our cash flow. And so, that being said, you know, we see value in having some cushion, and we've been operating with a cushion for the last couple of years.
Neel Mitra -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
OK, can I ask one additional one since the first one is going to go to the Analyst Day?
Kim Dang -- President
Yeah.
Neel Mitra -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
When you said that GCX can support the -- the downstream assets maybe with an expansion, can you explain what you meant by that comment?
Sital Mody -- President, Natural Gas
This is Sital. I think what Kim was talking about is what -- you know, one, we have the ability to expand GCX. I think, you know, as -- as the intrastate industrial market and power market evolve, there's an opportunity to probably do some downstream expansions to carry those volumes into that corridor. I think that's what Kim was referring to.
Rich Kinder -- Executive Chairman
And I think, just to add something, this just demonstrates the tremendous ability we have to expand and extend our system. I think it's hard for people to realize exactly how extensive this is in Texas and Louisiana. But every time we put more gas into the system, it brings the opportunity to expand further downstream. And that's a big reason why Kim has said repeatedly that on our expansion capex target, we think we'll be at the upper end of that range from 1 billion to 2 billion. We'll be at the upper end of that range.
And that's the kind of opportunities we're seeing. They don't necessarily make it into a backlog, but they're out there and things we can take advantage of as more and more gas flows through the system.
Neel Mitra -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Got it. I appreciate all the color.
Operator
Thank you. Next, we will hear from Theresa Chen with Barclays. You may proceed.
Theresa Chen -- Barclays -- Analyst
Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. First, just a quick follow-up related to the longer-term guidance on the STX acquisition. In order to get to the 7 and 7.5 times multiple over multiple years, is there any capex associated with that, and how much?
Kim Dang -- President
There may be a little bit, but it is not -- it's not material.
Theresa Chen -- Barclays -- Analyst
Got it. And on the product side in California, given the ample supply of diesel into the state, with renewable diesel being produced in state as well as entering into the state from other areas, it looks like, you know, the state may be short in gasoline over time as in-state refineries convert. With this backdrop, is there an incremental bid for gasoline imports? Are there opportunities for your waterborne terminals there?
Tom Martin -- President, CO2 and Energy Transition Ventures
Yeah, I think, you know, at the end of the day, whether the barrels are supplied by the PADD 5 refiners or imported, I think they'll move on our pipelines. You know, I think as long as the demand is there -- the inland demand is there and as well as the demand in the bay areas and the LA areas that move across our racks, you know, whether it's produced in California or it comes -- comes in, I think it'll -- I think it'll find its way into our assets.
Theresa Chen -- Barclays -- Analyst
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Zack Van Everen with TPH and Company. Your line is open.
Zack Van Everen -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Company -- Analyst
Hey, thanks, guys, for taking my question. Just following back up on the Permian pipeline, is there a market that you guys are looking more toward, whether it's Agua Dulce, or Carthage, or Houston, that would make more sense at the time for a new pipe?
Tom Martin -- President, CO2 and Energy Transition Ventures
So, look, we -- we like them all. But, you know, as I said, we're in a very competitive environment that we're in. I think, you know, ultimately, there's a need and -- and probably both locations, right? And so, really, that's all I say. And we're trying -- like I said, we'd like them all, I'm not sure we're going to get them all. So, I'm not sure if I answered your question, but I think there's a -- there's probably a pipe that needs to get to the eastern Louisiana coast, you know, ultimately across to serve kind of the -- the Louisiana Gulf Coast corridor.
And there's probably a pipe that needs to get to South Texas.
Kim Dang -- President
And ultimately, the customers and the customer contracts will drive that.
Tom Martin -- President, CO2 and Energy Transition Ventures
That's right.
Zack Van Everen -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Company -- Analyst
OK, that makes sense. And then, turning to, you know, M&A, I know you all don't rule it out. And one of your peers this year will have some assets on the market. Curious if you guys would ever step out of the U.S.
for assets or mostly focused on just U.S. assets for M&A.
Kim Dang -- President
Sure, I mean we will look at the opportunity, that's what I was saying. I would say, in general, what we have found outside of the U.S., is that it's hard to get the types of risk-adjusted returns that we would like to get. And so, you know, because you've got different tax issues associated with repatriating the cash, and you know, generally returns depending on which market you're talking about, but returns have been lower in most of those international markets. So, I think what I'm saying is I doubt that happens, but we will look at those opportunities.
We don't -- we don't pass up, you know, looking at things and evaluating whether that could make sense and whether that has -- there are synergies with our existing assets. So, you know, I'll just leave it at that.
Zack Van Everen -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Company -- Analyst
All right, perfect. That's all I had. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Harry Mateer with Barclays. Your line is open.
Harry Mateer -- Barclays -- Analyst
Hi, good afternoon. You know, first one, for the past couple of quarters, you've been disclosing in your 10-Q some potential financial effects from the EPA's Good Neighbor Act with the high end of the range fairly material. I just wonder if you can update us on where you stand in that process and things we can keep an eye out for, you know, in terms of whether the ultimate effect winds up being toward the -- the higher or lower end of the range.
Kim Dang -- President
Yeah, and I'll -- I'll repeat some of the stuff that we've said in the past, but I mean we think this is a flawed rule and it was a flawed process. You know, it's heavily challenged and is legitimately challenged. Every state that has requested a stay on their state plans has prevailed, so this has stayed in the 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, and 9th Circuit courts. And with respect to the -- the federal plan, that has been appealed to the Supreme Court.
And -- and what we think is a very positive sign, the Supreme Court has requested a hearing that will happen later in February. So, you know, where that leaves us is, you know, there are only three states right now, where KMI -- where the rule is not stayed and KMI is -- is impacted. And so, that -- the impacts that we disclose in the 10-K are much smaller, and I think we -- we discussed that in there as well, the potential impacts I should say.
Harry Mateer -- Barclays -- Analyst
Got it. All right. Thank you.

Hello, everyone, and welcome to Devon Energy fourth quarter and full year 2023 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator instructions] This call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Scott Coody, vice president of investor relations.
Sir, you may begin.
Scott Coody -- Vice President, Investor Relations
Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call today. Last night, we issued an earnings release and presentation that covered Devon's results for the past year and our outlook for 2024. Throughout the call today, we will make references to the earnings presentation to support prepared remarks, and these slides can be found on our website. Also, joining me on the call today are Rick Muncrief, our president and CEO; Clay Gaspar, our chief operating officer; Jeff Ritenour, our chief financial officer; and a few other members of our senior management team.
Comments today will include plans, forecasts, and estimates that are forward-looking statements under U.S. securities law. These comments are subject to assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Please take note of the cautionary language and risk factors provided in our SEC filings and earnings materials.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Hey. Thank you, Scott, and I appreciate everyone taking time to join us this morning. For today, my comments will be centered on four key themes: Devon's accomplishments in 2023, the catalyst of our improved outlook for 2024, the depth of the resource we possess in our portfolio, and the strategic priorities that will drive our free cash flow allocation going forward. Now, beginning with the fourth quarter, we exited the year with a solid quarter of execution, highlighted by production that exceeded the top end of guidance, beating consensus across all products.
Disciplined reinvestment resulted in our 14th consecutive quarter of free cash flow, and we took steps to increase cash returns by stepping up the pace of our stock buyback. These positive results rounded out another successful year for Devon where we achieved several key milestones that I am extremely proud of. On Slide 7, you can see we delivered production growth rate of 8% in 2023, resulting in new high all-time production for oil. This healthy growth rate was also paired with returns on capital employed that outpaced the S&P 500 by a substantial margin for the third straight year.
With the free cash flow our business produced, we rewarded shareholders with an impressive cash return yield of around 10% that was balanced between buybacks and dividends. As I touched on during the last call, our team has done a great job of designing a plan to deliver improved capital efficiency in 2023 -- excuse me, 2024. With the current industry conditions, we still believe it is prudent to deploy a steady capital program designed to optimize returns while maintaining volumes around levels where we exited 2023. Importantly, we expect to deliver this production for 10% less capital versus last year, funded at a WTI break-even price of around $40.
In conjunction with this outlook and given the confidence that we have in the underlying health of our business, the board has approved a 10% increase to our fixed dividend payout. Now, looking briefly at the trajectory of our capital and production profile in 2024 on Slide 9, we plan to be spending -- to be slightly elevated in the first half of the year due to the addition of a fourth completion crew in the Delaware Basin. Due to timing of completions and recent curtailments from extreme winter weather, we expect first quarter production to be the lowest quarter of the year. However, we expect volumes and capital efficiency to move higher over the remainder of the year.
In 2024, a key contributor to our improved capital efficiency will be the well productivity improvements we expect to achieve in the Delaware Basin. Turning to Slide 12. And with the easing of constraints across the basin, we plan to concentrate roughly 70% of the Delaware's capital in New Mexico while optimizing the remaining activity across our acreage in Texas. This allocation to New Mexico is meaningfully higher than what we were able to deploy during 2023 and is more in line with our historic activity in the basin.
Overall, this refined capital allocation is expected to increase well productivity in the Delaware by up to 10% on a year-over-year basis. Given that two-thirds of our Delaware Basin inventory is in New Mexico, we anticipate being able to sustain our pace of activity on both sides of the Stateline for the foreseeable future. With this advantaged acreage footprint, you can see on Slide 14 that we have one of the largest inventories among operators in the basin, providing us with a multidecade resource that will drive our enterprisewide performance for many years to come. The quality of our Delaware-weighted resource base, combined with our disciplined strategy, positions us to generate a differentiated amount of free cash flow for many years to come.
As you can see on Slides 15 and 16, our business is set to deliver a free cash flow yield that is up to three times that offered by the broader markets. With this free cash flow, we are targeting a cash return payout of around 70%, while earmarking the remainder to further strengthen our balance sheet. With our flexible cash return framework, we will judiciously allocate our free cash flow toward the best opportunity, whether that be buybacks or dividends. Given that the equity market is heavily discounting valuations in the energy sector, it's an easy decision to prioritize a buyback over the variable dividend to capture the incredible value that Devon offers at these historically low valuations.
And Slide 19 helps better visualize this compelling value proposition. On the right, you can see energy represents less than 4% of the S&P 500 while contributing more than 10% of the EBITDA in 2023. This is noteworthy given the energy's S&P weighting historically tracks its earnings contribution over time. I believe this gap exists due to extreme valuations in tech, combined with a pervasive misunderstanding of hydrocarbon demand over time.
With global energy demand forecasted to increase 50% by 2050, the world is going to need growth from all sources of energy, including oil and natural gas. With the world's power needs continuing to grow, it is evident that peak oil demand is nowhere in sight and our industry will be an important contributor of energy growth for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, high-quality names like Devon provide significant equity upside over time as you collect outside -- outsized cash returns. And as I said earlier, this is why we are putting our money to work actively repurchasing shares.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Clay.
Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer
Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. The Devon team did a really good job of rounding out 2023 by exceeding our operational targets for the fourth quarter. These positive results were driven by three key factors: number one, improved uptime, driving base production; number two, increased efficiencies through faster cycle times, resulting in lower capital per well; and number three, better new well productivity, improving our wedge production volume. Slide 5 provides a good visual of these favorable operating trends.
The chart on the left highlights the efficiencies we've delivered in our drilling and completions operations. On the right, you can see this track record of efficiency gains is also paired with some of the best well productivity of any producer in the U.S. While these results can certainly vary from quarter to quarter, our consistency over time demonstrates the quality of our assets and execution capabilities. The most significant contributor to this advantaged capital efficiency was our franchise asset in the Delaware Basin.
In the fourth quarter, roughly 60% of our capital was deployed to this prolific basin, allowing us to run a consistent program of 16 rigs. This activity -- with this activity, we brought online 62 new wells, grew productivity 6% year over year, and expanded our DUC inventory, allowing us to add a fourth completion crew earlier this year. While we had strong results across our acreage position in the quarter, the top contributors to our performance were several large pads within our Cotton Draw and Stateline areas. At Cotton Draw, in the core of the basin, we brought on 11 three-mile laterals that showcased the stacked-pay potential and prolific rates this area can deliver.
These extended-reach wells were diversified across five different producing intervals in the Avalon, Bone Spring, and Wolfcamp formations. In aggregate, the oil-weighted production from these wells achieved 30-day rates of 4,400 BOE per day, with impressive per-well recoveries trending as high as 4 million BOE. In addition to the high rates at Cotton Draw, we also delivered record-setting drilling and completion times. This performance included a record completion pace of 3,100 feet per day, and drilling times for these three-mile laterals came in as low as 19 days, with the final mile drilled in a record time of just over 24 hours.
Another standout performance during the quarter and possibly my favorite in terms of naming convention was our Clawhammer Project in the Stateline area. Clawhammer was named by a geologist after the style of playing the banjo that his dad used in their family jam sessions. The good news for him and his family is that these wells are fantastic. This eight-well pad consists of two-mile laterals co-developed in multiple intervals in the Wolfcamp A.
With production rates averaging 3,900 BOE per day, this package of wells delivered the highest well productivity per lateral foot of any project during the quarter. As I look ahead to 2024, I expect another big year for the Delaware Basin as we have a great slate of projects lined up. We plan to bring online around 215 wells for the year, with most of the capital deployed toward the best parts of our acreage in southern Lea and Eddy counties and the Stateline area of Texas. This plan is designed to deliver improved capital efficiency and better well productivity through the full column of development of the Upper Wolfcamp, along with select landing zones in the Wolfcamp B, where applicable.
The de-risking of multiple targets in the Wolfcamp B over the past year has allowed us to pursue more extensive multizone developments in 2024, bolstering our high-quality inventory, delivering higher net present value for project, and still delivering exceptional rates of return. Turning to Slide 13. To build upon Rick's comments from earlier, we're confident in our ability to deploy more capital to the core of the Delaware because of a long list of improvements in infrastructure. These improvements include 2 Bcf a day of processing additions -- gas processing additions, expansions to the downstream gas takeaway, enhanced water handling capabilities with our WaterBridge joint venture, build-out of gathering and compression, and investment in self-generated power and microgrids to increase the reliability of the electrical infrastructure.
With these improvements, we are very well positioned to execute on our 2024 plan. In fact, year to date, we're delivering at a pace ahead of schedule, allowing us to fully offset the winter weather downtime we experienced in January across the field. Shifting to the Eagle Ford. The successful integration of our Validus acquisition was one of the key drivers of the production increase of 56% during 2023.
With our enhanced scale in the basin, the team did a great job of capturing synergies by driving improvements across each phase of our operations. This progress can be seen through several indicators, including year-over-year 15% decrease in production costs, a 30%-plus improvement in completion cycle times over the course of the year, and we set a company record spud rig release of only five days. Our activity during the year continued to demonstrate that the Eagle Ford provides one of the most promising opportunities for resource upside in the U.S. shale.
Through tighter redevelopment spacing and refracs, our capital program not only replenished but expanded our risk resource in the play to an inventory runway of around 10 years at today's pace of activity. Looking to 2024, our key focus for the Eagle Ford team is to sharpen capital efficiency by incorporating appraisal learnings from the past year, along with a more balanced activity across Dewitt and Karnes counties. This plan is expected to deliver single-digit production growth for roughly $75 million less capital over last year. In the Rockies, we possess a unique combination of assets that can provide both growth and free cash flow.
Specifically in the Powder River Basin, we are building upon the well productivity improvements achieved over the past couple of years where the average six-month queues increased nearly 20% from historic levels. A recent highlight was the [Inaudible] 3x well, which reached peak rates in Q4. This three-mile Niobrara well achieved initial production rates greater than 1,500 BOE per day, with an 85% oil cut, and then hung in at that rate for quite a while. In addition to the strong oil productivity, the [Inaudible] attained a record drilling performance of 1,350 feet per day, a 45% improvement compared to the average Niobrara well.
In 2024, our efforts will be focused on refining spacing, reducing costs, and continuing to ready this asset for full development in later part of this decade. In the Williston, I want to thank the team for safely working through the incredibly severe winter storm weather that we experienced in January and rapidly restoring effective production. As I look into 2024, our focus for this asset will be to optimize base production, deploy selective investments to high-confidence projects, and harvest $300 million of field-level cash flow. So far this year, our capital program is off to a great start with our bull moose project maxing out our production facilities at over 15,000 barrels of oil per day, with several of the wells flowing 3,000 barrels per day or more during their flowback.
Lastly, I'd like to briefly cover our activity in the Anadarko Basin, where we delivered an 8% production growth rate during 2023. The three-rig drilling program funded by our Dow joint venture delivered very impressive well production. The value of these -- this production was also enhanced by our ability to route volumes into the premium southeast gas markets and by the team driving operational costs 10% lower. In 2024, we plan to maintain a similar pace of drilling activity in the Anadarko, with a keen focus on developing the liquids-rich window of the play, where returns from our joint venture activity will benefit from higher condensate cuts.
And with that, I'll turn the call to Jeff for financial review. Jeff.
Jeff Ritenour -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Clay. I'll spend my time today discussing the highlights of our financial performance in 2023 and the priorities for our free cash flow as we head into 2024. Beginning with our fourth quarter financial performance, Devon's operating cash flow totaled $1.7 billion, exceeding consensus estimates, and represents the highest quarterly total of the year. This cash flow comfortably funded our capital spending and resulted in $827 million of free cash flow, driving full year free cash flow to $2.7 billion.
Even in the face of headwinds from lower commodity prices, this level of free cash flow ranks as one of the highest in Devon's 50-year-plus history. Another powerful example of the consistent financial results our disciplined strategy can deliver. As Rick touched on earlier, with this free cash flow, we're targeting a cash return payout of 70%, with the remainder of reserve for balance sheet improvement. Slide 23 in the appendix is a good exhibit representing how we allocated our cash returns in the most recent quarter.
Given the compelling valuation of our equity, we prioritize share repurchases over the variable dividend. This resulted in us repurchasing 5.2 million shares in the fourth quarter at a total cost of $234 million. In 2024, we've continued to actively acquire shares through our 10b5-1 program, and we plan to supplement this with systematic buying with open market purchases during the year. With plenty of runway remaining on our $3 billion buyback authorization, we see Devon's current valuation as a great opportunity to compound the per-share growth for our investors.
In addition to our buyback activity, we delivered investors an attractive stream of income through our fixed plus variable dividend framework. In the fourth quarter, we declared a dividend payout of $0.44 per share that is payable at the end of March. This dividend consists -- consist of the board's approval to increase the fixed dividend by 10% to $0.22 per share and declare a variable distribution of $0.22 per share. We continue to believe dividends are a great way to reward shareholders and are a critical contributor to total returns over time.
We also believe that the flexibility designed into our dividend framework allows us to return meaningful and appropriate amounts of cash to shareholders across a variety of market conditions through the cycle. Moving to the balance sheet. Devon's investment-grade financial position continued to strengthen in the fourth quarter with cash balances increasing by $144 million to a total of $875 million. In addition to our strong liquidity, we exited the year with low leverage, marked by a net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.7 times.
Looking ahead, with the excess free cash flow that accrues to our balance sheet, we plan to build liquidity and retire maturing debt. Our next debt maturity comes due in September of this year, totaling $472 million, and we will have the opportunity to retire another $485 million of notes in 2025. So, in summary, our financial strategy is working well. We have successfully scaled our business to consistently generate free cash flow.
We are boosting per-share results by opportunistically repurchasing our shares. We offer a dividend yield that far exceeds that of the broader markets. And the balance sheet is in great shape, with a clear pathway of continued improvement over the next few years. With that, I'll turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.
Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Jeff. So, to wrap up our prepared remarks, I want to reinforce a few key messages. Number one, Devon is a great company that has created a tremendous amount of value for shareholders since we unveiled our industry-first cash return strategy announced in 2020. Since that time, we've deployed $13 billion to dividends, buybacks, debt reduction, and accretive acquisitions.
I'm extremely proud of this accomplishment, but we're just getting started. 2024 is setting up to be another wonderful year for Devon. By incorporating learnings from the past year and refining our capital allocation, we expect to deliver a step-change improvement in capital efficiency this year. This improved capital efficiency is anchored by our assets in the Delaware Basin, where we expect to deliver the powerful combination of improved well productivity for much lower capital cost.
Our long-duration resource base, underpinned by the Delaware, is one of the deepest of any company out there. The resource quality provides us an advantaged platform to drive attractive per-share growth and outsized cash returns for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Scott, and let's have some Q&A.
Scott Coody -- Vice President, Investor Relations
Thanks, Rick. We'll now open the call to Q&A. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. This allows us to get to more of your questions on the call today.
With that operator, we'll take our first question.
Questions & Answers:

Operator
Perfect. Thank you. [Operator instructions] We do have our first question registered. It comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.
Neil, your line is now open.
Neil Mehta -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Yeah. Thank you very much, Rick and team. Rick, I know, over the last year, you've talked about some of your frustration around execution on the oil volume side, that this is going to be an important year for that operational inflection. It does seem like we're seeing some evidence of that with capital efficiency and holding the 315 oil guide.
So, maybe you could just give us your perspective on whether we're at that inflection point from an ops perspective?
Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer
You know, Neil, that's a good question. You know, we have expressed our frustration, I think, in the market, really. You know, we really traded down on some of our variances we saw last year in our production volumes. But even though they were minor, that the -- from a volumetric standpoint, they weren't from a stock performance standpoint.
So, I think this setup is really good for investors as we look forward. So, it is going to be, I believe, a point of inflection for us, as we -- as we've mentioned. We're really bullish about our performance. The team has done a wonderful job getting us through some tough weather.
We've seen some increased productivity. I think Clay went through the assets really well. And we're seeing nice growth on the oil side coming out of the -- out of this -- the first quarter as we enter second, third, fourth quarters of this year. And I'll also say, Neil, I feel really good about the next several years on our ability to keep crude volumes where they're at.
I think that it's -- we're still early. We still are not getting what I think is a strong, strong signal for demand. But when that call comes, I think we'll be ready to step up for it. But really feel good about the trends we're seeing.
Neil Mehta -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Yeah. And just maybe to build on this, this might be a question for Clay, but just can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of well productivity that gives you confidence in your ability to hit or exceed that 315 oil number this year?
Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Neil. You know, this is one of the frustrating things about a publicly traded company. We get to see what's coming, we get to see what's happening well before the market does.
And so, where I can see the improvement internally in the well productivity from the first half of last year to the second half of last year, those numbers are just starting to hit the public markets and through the public sources. And so, I think that's, you know, pretty evident for those that are paying attention that this is not at first quarter '24, we decided to turn on the production. This is an evolution. We wanted to make some really thoughtful investments in the future of the company.
We did that. The market, I believe, responded pretty vigorously to that. We've since made some changes in the planning, the well delivery. The well performance has really significantly taken an uptick.
As I mentioned, even late last year, you see some of that coming through the public sources. We're going to -- it's really going to manifest in 2024. And as Rick mentioned, we're just off to a really good start, even recovering from a pretty severe storm that we saw somewhere 1% to 2% impact. You know, we always bake in winter weather, but an event like that was pretty out of the norm.
The productivity of the wells, the performance, we've been able to overcome that, and we feel really good about delivering -- being able to deliver the '24 full year numbers.
Neil Mehta -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
All right. Thanks, Clay. Thanks, Rick.
Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram from J.P. Morgan. Arun, your line is now open.
Arun Jayaram -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Yeah. Good morning, gentlemen. Rick and Clay, you've highlighted your expectations to deliver up to 10% well productivity gains in the Delaware Basin. I was wondering if you could maybe help us -- provide more details on what is driving that.
Sounds like there's going to be some high grading for Monument Draw to southeast in New Mexico. But I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what's driving that and if completion optimization is also a driver of better year-over-year productivity.
Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer
Thanks for the question, Arun. I think both things come into play. You know, the big headline thing is just a refocus to more where we've historically allocated our capital, kind of in the core of the basin, predominantly where our inventory and our portfolio lays out between New Mexico and Texas. I would say, '23, especially first half of '23, was a little bit of an anomaly on where we were allocating that capital, and we needed to do some work from the infrastructure standpoint, but also really understanding where all these fit together.
We're benefiting tremendously from that work, from that infrastructure build-out, and that's where we're seeing the improvement really late '23 to what we're showing today. On the completions questions, I wouldn't point to -- it's a big knob that we've changed on -- excuse me, like a sand concentration or how we're doing what we're doing. But the team is working every single day to think about how do we do it better, how do we touch a little bit more rock, and how do we do it more cost-effectively. And I can tell you, we're winning on all fronts.
These are small wins at this point. It's a relatively mature way of thinking about these assets, but really, really pleased with the continued improvement there. And that shows up in the numbers as well.
Arun Jayaram -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Quick follow-up. Rick, you know, Devon, as you know, has been linked to a few M&A deals in the financial press. I was wondering if you could just comment on where we -- where you sit today in terms of your A&D strategy and how you gauge some of the inorganic opportunities versus, as Jeff mentioned, you know, the ability to buy back your stock at a 9% kind of free cash flow yield today?
Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, very good question. You know, Arun, our answer has really not changed that much over the last several years. We're going to continue to evaluate opportunities. You know, when you're in five basins, you have some great opportunities in all five of those, and we watch that, we stay attuned to those opportunities as they, you know, come available or it's the right time for us to think about that.
You know, I don't -- so I think we're going to continue to see the high bar. We're going to -- it's got to be -- it has to have some accretion. It has to have the industrial logic that we have always talked about. And it just has to make us a better company.
And if it's -- if it fits, you know, in that framework, you know, man, I think that's our job is to create value for shareholders. And so, we're going to do that. We also have been advocates for consolidation. I think some of the transactions that's been announced that I think that they're -- I think they're positive for the industry, and it just shows that we are a depleting industry.
And so, you always have to replenish -- that's -- you know, your portfolio that's not changed. It's not changed since, you know, the beginning of this industry. And so, we'll always be active. We've got a great team.
We've got great analytics capabilities in-house. And we do our own internal analytics, compare that with what you see on the public market and adjust. But once again, we're going to be very, very measured, very disciplined, and we will make some -- I think, the right decisions. That does include buying our stock back because I can tell you that at these levels, we are very, very attractive.
But great question.
Arun Jayaram -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst

Our next question comes from Nitin Kumar from Mizuho. Nitin, your line is now open.
Nitin Kumar -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst
Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Rick, I've heard you say and just say multiple times today that, you know, buybacks are very attractive, especially at these levels.
But as I look at fourth quarter, the mix actually favors dividends, including the variable payout a bit. Not to nitpick or anything like that, but just want to understand, you know, what drove the decision. We applaud the 10% increase in the base dividend, but what drove the decision for the variable dividend and how should we see that evolve in 2024?
Jeff Ritenour -- Chief Financial Officer
Hey, Nitin. This is Jeff. Keep in mind that there is some variance in the timing of the variable dividend payout, right? So, when we announce it, it actually gets paid in the subsequent quarter. So, maybe that's what you're alluding to as it relates to the mix.
But, you know, with our framework going forward, we're going to simply each quarter focus on delivering about 70% of our free cash flow back to shareholders in the form of that fixed dividend, which, obviously, we grew at 10% here on a year-over-year basis. That's the first and foremost. Going to be a priority for us. And we're going to look to continue to grow that on an annual basis going forward.
Then beyond that, we're absolutely biased toward leaning in on the share repo here in the near term. And frankly, the variable dividend will fall out of the back of that based on that 70% threshold that I hit on earlier. So, we're going to continue to expect to have a higher mix of buyback going forward, and that's going to be our priority as we walk it through this year.
Nitin Kumar -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst
Great. Thanks, Jeff. And then my next question was really for Clay, probably. Clay, impressive improvements in operating efficiencies, you know, days drilled, days completed.
Just curious, is there any specific technology that you would point to that have helped you achieve those? And I just -- you know, never say never, but where are we in terms of those efficiencies? Are we getting to some sort of baseline or do you think we can continue to deliver those type of improvements?
Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer
Nitin, it really goes down -- goes back to just the core operating team. These are highly talented, highly motivated individuals that are absolutely trying to do the right thing ultimately for the shareholders they work for. Now, I will remind you, this is the same team working just as hard with just as much creativity this year as they were last year. What we've found is we really needed to focus -- we underestimated what a slight change in capital efficiency during the first half of '23 meant to investors.
I think that was way over-extrapolated into us running out of inventory. Not being able to do this anymore, we lost our minds, all that good fun. And what we showed is like hang on one second, we still have the capabilities. We've got some really impressive inventory, some great quality.
And importantly, these are hardworking impressive people that continue to find a way to do it better each quarter. And this is so many things below the radar that don't always show up in -- in the -- in various data or don't show up in the financials. I can tell, you we're winning on lots and lots of fronts, and there's more of that to come. So, really excited about the go forward.
I think we've got some good transparency in our slides on quantity of resource, quality of resource. I expect in '24 that we'll regain a little bit of public mojo. But, you know, that, to me, is just a -- it's a little overdue. So, looking forward to sharing that win with the team.
Nitin Kumar -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst
OK. Thanks, guys.

Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Doug, your line is now open.
Kalei Akamine -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Hey. Good morning, guys. This is actually Kalei on for Doug. So, thanks for getting me on.
For my first question, I want to go back to the buyback, just to follow up. I want to understand the motivations behind the strategy for '24. Shifting capital back to the Delaware and the margin is obviously an efficiency shift and that makes sense. But in tandem, you're also leaning back into the buyback, and that looks rather intentional.
So, can you talk about why you see the buyback as the preferred allocation today and why has that changed over the past several months?
Jeff Ritenour -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, you bet. So, again, on the buyback front, you know, it's pretty clear to us as we kind of walk through our framework for evaluating share repo, you know, versus the other capital allocation opportunities that we have, whether it be organic investment, inorganic investment that Rick spoke to earlier, whether it's M&A or otherwise. And then when we step back and look at the valuation, you know, we look at the multiples, we look at our intrinsic value model that we keep in-house, you know, and run multiple sensitivities on that. Every which way we turn, what we keep coming back to is the -- our shares look undervalued, you know, relative to the broader market, relative to the sector, and certainly relative to the results that we expect to post as we walk our way through this year.
So, that really has been the driver and our focus, you know, going back to the back half of last year and as we walk into 2024. And that's why we're biased toward having the lion's share of our cash returns be focused on the share repurchase going forward.
Kalei Akamine -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
[Inaudible]
Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer
And if I could, I just want to -- this is Clay. I want to add one --
Kalei Akamine -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Go ahead.
Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer
I'm sorry. I just want to add one comment on that prior question. I think it's a common misconception the way we lay the numbers out that we are leaning in or that we're increasing capital to the Delaware somehow accelerating. That's not really the case.
We are the same rig count, same level of activity. The capital is actually coming down, not just in the total company, but in Delaware. But where we're seeing the 10% inflection from the company is really a reduction in some of the other areas. So, proportionately, Devon -- Delaware is moving up, but on an absolute basis, we're not consuming that inventory any faster than we had in '23 or years before.
Kalei Akamine -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Got it. I appreciate that, and that's where my follow-up will go. So, I'm wondering if the reduction in the capital in these other areas, what kind of permanence does that have? Is it sort of a stopgap until you figure out what's going on in the Bakken or is this now the direction of the program?
Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer
Was the question permanence?
Kalei Akamine -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Yeah. The permanence of the capital allocation.
Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer
Permanence, meaning how long --
Kalei Akamine -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Yeah. Yes.
Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer
Can we do it for multiple years? I'm just making sure I understand the question.
Kalei Akamine -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Yes. How many years can you run this kind of capital program?
Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer
OK.
Kalei Akamine -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
What's optimum --
Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer
All right. Thank you for that. Sorry. The acoustics in here weren't quite right.
So, sorry about that. Yeah, you know, I think in pulling back the activity, for example, on the Williston Basin, that prolongs that basin's opportunity to continue to deliver free cash flow and offset some of that fall-in in production with some really healthy wells. What we found is we were pushing a little too quickly, a little too much capital to that asset by having the multiple basins that we do. Having our franchise asset in the Delaware Basin, it allows us to take a little bit of pressure off that team.
It allows them to really make sure that all the ducks are in a row, ready for that next pad. And then selectively, we're going to fund those. And as you saw with the bull moose that I talked about on the call, these are phenomenal. These are awesome returns.
And we've got more of that to come.
Kalei Akamine -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Thanks for the comments.

Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann from Truist. Neal, your line is now open.
Neal Dingmann -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
Good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. Clay, my first question is probably for you. It's on your Delaware infrastructure and takeaway.
I'm just wondering, after adding so much -- I saw this slide where you talked about adding so much processing, gathering, compression, water. I'm just wondering now, are you all able to handle the continued notable upside that's going to come with the development plan or will there be a continued build-out?
Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer
Neal, we feel really good about being able to effectively produce. Remember, we are really watching our flaring. We don't want to have unnecessary shut-ins. We are reliant on so many third parties.
We want to make sure that we had that runway ahead of these very prolific pads coming online. We want to make sure we have that. We do feel very confident in that today. And remember, it's not just, you know, our immediate wells, we've got some really high-quality offset operators that know what they're doing as well.
It's a phenomenal basin, and we have to make sure that all of that plays together very nicely, and so that we have the reliability in the infrastructure to bring these wells online and make sure we ultimately get them to market.
Neal Dingmann -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
Yeah. Makes sense. And then my second is just on the Eagle Ford specifically. Can you give details -- I think you talked about an 85 to 95 well planned.
I'm just wondering, will the focus here be on existing key areas like you're doing in the Del and just maybe talk about any improvements we should think about specifically in this area?
Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer
Thanks for that question. I -- I'm really excited about the Eagle Ford. I -- you know, one of the things, unlike a lot of other areas, we've continued to test down spacing, tighter wells, subsequent wells. After the initial development has been done, bringing additional wells in, which is really not very favorable in most basins, it tends to work and continue to provide upside in the Eagle Ford.
Now, when you pair that with some of the refrac activity, we can actually feather in new wells, refrac some of the existing wells, and we're seeing phenomenal results. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are continuing to expand the runway there without any M&A dollars, without -- you know, just from the existing footprint, the opportunity set continues to expand. And these are very prolific, very accretive to the bottom line kind of numbers that we're really excited about.

Our next question comes from Kevin MacCurdy from Pickering Energy Partners. Kevin, your line is now open.
Kevin MacCurdy -- Pickering Energy Partners -- Analyst
Hey. Good morning. My first question is on the capital budget. We appreciate that the $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion range is a significant decrease year over year.
But if we look back at last year's budget, we noticed that the range is wider, both on absolute dollars and on percentage basis this year. I was wondering if you could provide any color on what might put you at the low end of that range versus the high end of the capital range. Is that driven more by deflation, turning lines, or midstream spend?
Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer
Yeah, it's interesting, Kevin. You know, one of the first thing that comes to mind for me is the efficiency that I talked about on a couple of my slides. You guys know this very well. We've been at this game for quite a while.
Sometimes, that efficiency can pull more activity into the calendar year. Look, this is not our first rodeo. This is February. We're already watching that for the full year.
We're committed to this range. But if I had to think of what could cause us to kind of float to the upside, it's probably that kind of work where you're seeing more opportunities bring some of that activity from '25 into '24. I think on the downside, you know, there's -- we're early in the year. I think the supply chain deflation opportunities are still -- you know, we've got a 5% year over year kind of baked in.
I feel good about that. I feel very confident we're going to be able to deliver that. As the year plays out, you know, we really need to see where that changes over time. My current crystal ball doesn't see a lot of inflation, but there are certainly deflation opportunities in that number, and that potentially could allow us to float or float down to the lower end of that range.
Kevin MacCurdy -- Pickering Energy Partners -- Analyst
I appreciate the detail on that. And as a follow-up, the Eagle Ford had a strong production quarter, and it looks like the capex guidance for that asset is fairly consistent year over year. Can you talk about the production and capital efficiency outlook in the Eagle Ford and if there's any major changes between 2023 and 2024?
Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Kevin. This is Rick. One of the things that I've been really proud of over the last 12 to 18 months is coming on the heels of the Validus acquisition, what we have been able to learn. It's a solid acreage.
It's -- I would say, it is second, certainly, to our Black Hawk acreage. But the thing about it that we need to remind investors of and analyst of is that on the Black Hawk acreage, it's a 50-50 joint venture with BPX. BPX operates the drilling and the completion of that. And what we felt, it was really from a -- not only a productivity increase, but also just a strategic perspective.
We thought it was imperative that we had an asset that we owned, that we did the drilling, that we did the completions on. The five-day well that Clay referenced a while ago, I can tell you, that absolutely exceeded anything that we had in our Validus, you know, development plan. So, when I look at that, I look -- now, we're having some very, very meaningful discussions with our joint venture partner there, and they're very constructive. And I think it's going to lead to even better performance over time in the Eagle Ford.
I'm really pleased with what we're seeing with the refrac program. It's going to continue to drive some -- I think some long-term sustainability down there that a lot of people, I think, are underestimating. So, I'll turn it over to Clay to add any additional color, but the Eagle Ford is an area, I can tell you, that we're very excited about.
Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer
Yeah, thanks for those comments, Rick. I think that's spot on. Kevin, the only thing I wanted to add is I do show a relatively meaningful drop, probably about a 10% or so drop in capital, about $75 million, the rough number I had, from '23 to '24. And so -- and again, that's with single-digit production growth on top of that.
Now, there is some well mix in there. We have a joint venture partner on part of the assets. We own the rest. We operate kind of a normal fashion.
So, there is some change in mix. But from a capital efficiency standpoint, things are moving in the right direction, and we continue to see upside potential on this particular asset.

Our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Scott, your line is now open.
Scott Gruber -- Citi -- Analyst
Yes. Good morning. The 10% improvement in productivity that you forecast in the Permian is normalized on a 10,000-foot lateral. Is it going to be a step up in lateral length in the play as you refocus on the quarter or is that going to be rather consistent?
Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer
Scott, it's pretty consistent year over year. We're always trying to drill longer laterals. It's kind of the opportunity set in front of us. We're always -- we feel very confident in our ability to deliver three-mile laterals from a productivity, from an operational standpoint.
The land mix doesn't always allow for that. So, we're going to be north of two miles, but not too much north, and it will be fairly consistent year over year.
Scott Gruber -- Citi -- Analyst
Got it. And then just a nuanced one on the 1Q guide. You know, last quarter, you provided that 305 of oil per day. Today, you're -- you're guiding for 640 with a 2% weather impact.
But 640 at, you know, a 48%-ish oil cut, you kind of still rounds maybe even slightly better than that 305 figure in last quarter. So, the question is, is the underlying trend in oil production slightly better and it's just being offset by a bigger weather impact, or is the weather risk, you know, that was incorporated in that original 305 guide kind of similar to what actually transpired?
Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer
Scott, I don't think it's really the well mix. The -- we've got some wells coming on. The Williston wells are exceptionally high in oil cut. We'll continue to bring those in.
I think that's just working in our favor in that regard.
Scott Gruber -- Citi -- Analyst
OK. Appreciate it. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC. Scott, your line is now open.
Scott Hanold -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst
Yeah. Thanks. If I can delve into the infrastructure a little bit more, you know, on Page 13, you obviously bucket, you know, three areas that you're focused on in terms of, you know, building support for the 2024 plan. You know, as you think about, you know, the Permian development over the next two, three, four years, like which area really are you focused most primarily on to make sure you're, you know, executing on the plan? Like where do you see the risk of the biggest constraint, I guess, is the question?
Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer
Scott, is all of the above an option? No, I mean, seriously, if any one of these things gets constrained and you're dead in the water or at least constrained. And so, we worked really hard to not just build what is the best rate of return opportunity set in our portfolio, but we're very thoughtful about modeling our own infrastructure, even modeling third-party infrastructure if we don't feel that they do an adequate job. And then there's the occasional curveball where one of the third parties, maybe even in the electrification front, can't come through with their normal pace. We need to have enough flexibility, enough forethought, enough creativity to be able to solve some of those problems essentially for them.
So, one of the things I mentioned is building out more of our own electrical infrastructure. We have about 700 miles of electrical -- electric lines in our basin already. We generate some of our own power. We have our own microgrids.
And this is really taking the bull by the horns out of necessity because, otherwise, the local power providers were not going to be able to keep up. So, those are the kind of proactive steps that we really leaned in probably with double effort in '23 because some of these historical norms have really changed, and we wanted to make sure that we didn't just bring on a bunch of wells and then be abnormally constrained and have to answer questions about why our wells are so terrible. So, anyway, I feel really good about the work that we did in '23 that we continue to do in '24. But look, we're not out of the woods.
We continue to look at infrastructure needs in '26, '27, and '28. We're working with partners as best we can. And I really think we have a great runway ahead of us. But the team is always on caution to make sure that we are prepared for those unforeseen challenges.
Scott Hanold -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst
OK. Thanks for that. And as my follow-up, it's going to be on M&A, and I was hoping to get a deeper sense of how you think about M&A. And it's really two parts.
One, you know, first, if you can comment on some of the recent deals that have been out there, you know, if you all participated in and, really, what was the gives and takes of why -- if you did, why Devon, you know, didn't win out? And the number two, you all mentioned, obviously, you're a multibasin player, but like when you think about like -- you know, does Devon have the scale right now that it would like? And if you were to add, would it be really most a Permian thing or, you know, are other of those basins open to more significant M&A for Devon?
Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. It's Rick, I'll fill that one. Number one, I really like the scale that we currently have. We have a deep resource base across our five basins that we're in.
So, I feel really good about that. But we're always -- as I mentioned earlier, we're always going to be looking to be opportunistic, to add resource, to add investment opportunities, you know, at a reasonable value, at an attractive value for our shareholders. I think that's just really incumbent upon this management team to always being on the hunt there. That being said, we are going to be very disciplined.
Some of the recent transactions, I think, were -- that were out there, that were announced, when I look at the metrics on those, those were rich. They really were. And others, you know, there's been a couple of them, they were hats off, really nice deals that we certainly weren't participating in those processes, but good for them. And that's great.
Congratulations. But for us, I want to just continue to drive home the point, we're going to continue to be disciplined, and we have to balance short-term accretion with long term -- how that fits in for the long haul for Devon. You know, we're a 50-year-old company. We're not a five-year-old company.
And we have to be really, really thoughtful about that. And so, we'll continue to look for opportunities, but we're going to maintain that discipline. And at the end of the day, we have a deep, deep resource base. And I think that's something that is incumbent upon this management team that we have to continue to drive home, and we have to demonstrate not only how we execute hitting numbers, exceeding them, whatever that is, but we just have to do a wonderful job and working with the outside community, outside investors on the resource that we have in-house currently.
Scott Hanold -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst
And then regionally, is there an area you focus a little bit more time on? Is it, you know, Permian, Bakken, Eagle Ford or like are all areas of focus?
Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer
You know, I think, for us, we're going to stick to our strategy that's really simply put, we want to stay as oily as we can for as long as we can. I think we're seeing that play out in real time with -- I'm not sure we got more gas prices as we sit here this morning again, but it's sub-$2. That's not a good spot to be in. And so, for us, we want to stay as oily and as liquid-rich as we possibly can because, throughout the entirety of my career, that's been the place to go.
Now, we're all -- I think we all are optimistic about the future of natural gas could be. And, you know, we spend quite a bit of time in DC talking about the importance of tone, the importance of consistency with some of our public policy, those sorts of things, and in our foreign trade policies. And so, we -- so for us, I think, near term, to answer your question, we're going to be very interested in oil-prone basins. Oil is going to drive the margins for the foreseeable future, and that's kind of where we want to be.
Scott Hanold -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst

Our next question comes from Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Charles, you may proceed with your question.
Charles Meade -- Johnson Rice and Company -- Analyst
Good morning, Rick, Clay, and Jeff. Rick, I want to ask a question about your Delaware Basin completion crews, and more specifically, if you could give us a sense of the composition of the four fleets you're running right now, whether those are all zipper fracs or whether there's any simulfrac crews in there. And where -- in the bigger sense, where I'm going with this, has there been any thought or there's any possibility of adjusting that mix to -- so that you're more on a steady-state program there?
Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I'm going to let Clay answer the balance of that. But, you know, just in real time, just yesterday, I was talking to one of our completion managers down there. And, you know, we're picking up the fourth crew, as we mentioned. But the three that have been out there, the -- it's incredible, Charles, on the efficiencies in what we're doing out there, the number of stages.
And it's interesting, there's a -- there's -- we're -- it's healthy competition, you know, between the team members and certain companies that are involved with it. And we're actively comparing and contrasting ways that we can get better and better. And at the end of the day, we want to make sure that we do this very, very safely and efficiently. And so, we're constantly changing.
Every bad has its unique characteristics. But I can tell you that, more and more, we just see these efficiencies that are just incredible. And things that, just 12 months ago, we knew that you'd see some efficiencies, but we're exceeding some expectations. Clay, won't you maybe [Inaudible]
Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer
Sure. I'll follow up, Charles. We have more simulfrac coming -- we're completing today and more to come throughout the year and go forward. One of the challenges of simulfrac, you really need to plan that 12 or 18 months ahead when you're planning the well site location, how many wells on one particular location, because that enables more ability to do some of that.
So, about 12 months ago, we started really kind of leaning in. Building a little bit larger number of wells per pad instead of separate pads, that allows for more simulfrac opportunity, which we're seeing great results and we're continuing to benefit from. We're also testing some very interesting things where we artificially tie pads together with some big lines between the two. So, there's some really creative stuff.
But again, it's a little below the radar typically of what we talk about in earnings calls. But I can tell you that the teams are doing just amazing work and really adding material value through these efficiencies to the bottom line of Devon. So, really appreciate the great work there.
Charles Meade -- Johnson Rice and Company -- Analyst
Got it. And then, Clay, I want to go back to your prepared comments. You were talking about -- I think I heard you talk about some additional landing zones in the Wolfcamp B. I'm not sure I kind of -- I caught it all when you were talking about it.
So, I was wondering if you could elaborate a bit on that and perhaps include in your answer an indication, is this something that you're going to be -- you know, that you're working into the '24 program or is this an out-year sort of project?
Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer
Yeah, I think, sometime last year, when we were deep in the penalty box, we talked about the highlights of some of the great work that the team did around understanding the Wolfcamp B. Now, that work is manifesting and more of that B coming to kind of that front end of the priority list. Really competitive, super accretive. And we're incorporating that landing zone into some of the development that we have during the course of '24 and beyond.
And so, here's how I would characterize it. This is landing zones that we knew were viable. We needed to test, we needed to understand, we needed to try some different configurations to really find the best approach. During the course of '23 -- '22 and '23, we did that.
We optimized a development approach. And now, in '24, we were benefiting from some of that. So, again, it probably was lost in some of the shuffle last year, but this is work that we did during the course of '23 that we're significantly benefiting from. This expands what I would consider some of our really Tier 1 runway.
It's stuff that was a little further out in the priority, on a risk basis. As we de-risked it, boy, it really has moved to the front of the pack, and really excited about the continued good work there.
Charles Meade -- Johnson Rice and Company -- Analyst
Thanks for the added detail.
Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer
You bet.
Operator
[Operator instructions] And our next question comes from David Deckelbaum from Cowen. David, your line is now open.
David Deckelbaum -- TD Cowen -- Analyst
Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. I appreciate the time. Rick or Clay, I wanted to ask just you talked about, Rick, obviously, the -- or Clay, the total dollar amount for the Delaware actually coming down this year. It looks like you're still obviously growing that asset.
You know, you guided, obviously, to a slight decline, I guess, at a corporate level. I'm wondering, you know, when you think about capital allocation, should we be consistently thinking about the Delaware as a growth asset over the next several years given the visibility that you have now where you can be allocating capital to within that basin?
Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer
You know, I think it's -- I would put it in the same category as Devon. We are a low growth, kind of 0% to 5%. Delaware will play a certain role. Some quarters or some years, it's going to be a little bit of a tick-up.
Others, it's going to be relatively flat. But I wouldn't think of it as a standout growth asset. We're really pleased with the year-over-year performance. As I mentioned, it did grow.
We also were able to build a few extra DUCs during the course of the second half of last year that we're able to capture the benefit of in the first half of this year. So, there's kind of that going on in the background, but I wouldn't say it's materially out of step with overall Devon or with the other basins.
Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Hey, David. It's Rick. I'll -- I will add that, you know, when we talk about it being, you know, flat to up slightly in the Delaware, that's on the oil side. And as you think about an improving -- structurally improving gas and NGL structure, you will see growth there.
So, I think you can look at it from a -- from an equivalent standpoint, it is a growth basin, and it's going to going to continue to be. That's what drove a lot of our 8% growth as a company last year. And so, I think you're going to see that continue to play out. That's not only true of us.
That's true of the entire Permian Basin. Whether it's on the Midland side or the Delaware side, you're going to continue to see gas production, NGL production continue to grow, even in a flat oil scenario.
David Deckelbaum -- TD Cowen -- Analyst
Thanks, Rick and Clay. And maybe, Rick, you know, one of the, I guess, other parts of the capital budget that continues to grow every year, albeit still small, is carbon capital. You know, in a world where you're trying to enhance returns of capital to shareholders, could you kind of contextualize how you see that spend generating returns for Devon as a whole and why that's sort of seeing a larger piece of the pie this year, albeit small?
Rick Muncrief -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. You know, I think it's a really good question, and it's a really important topic for us, not only as Devon, but as an industry. And it's something we're going to stay ahead of. You know, we have a change in regulations.
Devon wants to make sure that we stay ahead of the curve. And these regulations are coming at us quickly. What a lot of people don't understand is some of these regulations coming are so onerous that many of the low-volume wells that we have across this nation are going to end up being plugged. And so, you're going to see oil and natural gas wells that basically are stripper wells that we always refer them to that are such low volume, they just, quite honestly, cannot -- they cannot afford to, you know, spend capital on.
And it's just -- it's going to be a fact of life. And so, there are studies by API and some of the other trade groups that talk about that impact, but it is real. So, what Devon wants to do, we want to make sure that we're ahead of the curve, as I said, and it's something that will -- I think you'll see over time, it's going to continue to creep up for the next two or three years. We want to be very thoughtful about that and prudent with it and strategic about it.
But it is something to -- that we all just have to deal with it. It's a fact of life.
David Deckelbaum -- TD Cowen -- Analyst
And just for my own edification, is that capital being earmarked for projects that would allow you to prolong production on some of these wells such as increasing methane capture, or is this capital associated or tied to plugging and abandoning some of those wells that would be more regulatory headaches?
Clay Gaspar -- Chief Operating Officer
David, what I would characterize most of it is retrofitting existing facilities with better designs to lower emissions and, by the way, keep us well ahead of this coming regulation wave. So, you could look at this out of necessity. I think we're half a click ahead. We try and stay well ahead of just necessity.
But these are regulations that we will always make sure that we are staying in front of to continue to preserve our important rights as an organization to provide energy to fuel the world. So, thanks again for the questions, David.
David Deckelbaum -- TD Cowen -- Analyst
Thanks guys.
Scott Coody -- Vice President, Investor Relations

Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. First, I'd like to recognize some changes we made at our executive management level. Maryann Mannen has been appointed president of MPC.
In this role, she'll be responsible for our refining and marketing, commercial, and HES&S organization. John Quaid, previously CFO of MPLX, succeeds Maryann as CFO of MPC. In addition to these changes, Rick Hessling has been appointed chief commercial officer. Rick will lead our global feedstock and clean products teams with the goal of maximizing margin capture across the entire value chain.
Brian Partee has been appointed chief global optimization officer. Brian will be responsible for assessing and redefining business processes that are critical to improving our performance, including our value chain optimization efforts, and determining investments needed to accelerate the delivery of results. At a high level, these organizational changes put more emphasis on advancing important value-creating initiatives, driving increased performance throughout our entire value chain, and making a step change in our cash flow generation capability. Turning to our 2023 results.
We're pleased to continue to deliver on our strategic commitments. Full year cash provided by operating activities was over $14 billion on a consolidated basis, reflecting our team's strong execution. Our refining and marketing business delivered excellent full year results, generating EBITDA of $12.74 per barrel of throughput and capture of 100%. These results reflect strong utilization of our assets and improved execution against our commercial strategy.
Incremental to our refining and marketing results, our midstream business posted nearly $6.2 billion of EBITDA. EBITDA for the midstream segment grew by approximately 7% year over year or by approximately $400 million. We expect MPC will receive $2.2 billion of annual cash distributions, supported by MPLX's most recent 10% increase to its quarterly distribution. MPLX is strategic to MPC's portfolio.
Its current pace of cash distributions fully covers MPC's dividend and more than half of our planned 2024 capital program. We expect MPLX to increase its cash distributions as it pursues growth opportunities, further enhancing the value of this strategic relationship. We are committed to returning excess capital to shareholders. In 2023, we returned $11.6 billion through share repurchases, bringing total repurchases to over $29 billion since May of 2021.
In addition, we increased MPC's quarterly dividend by 10% in the fourth quarter. Over the past five years, we have grown our quarterly dividend at a compound annual growth rate of over 12%. For the full year 2023, this capital return represents a payout of 92% of our operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns. Executing on our commitments, combined with a strong macro environment, led to total shareholder returns of approximately 31% for MPC in 2023.
Turning to our view on the refining macro environment as we head into 2024. Global oil demand hit a record high in '23, and we see another year of record oil consumption in '24. The IEA is currently projecting demand growth of over 1.2 million barrels per day, with their projections having been raised higher over the last three consecutive months. In our system, both domestically and within our export business, we are seeing steady demand year over year for gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel.
Global supply remains constrained, and anticipated global capacity additions have progressed slower than expectations. Gasoline and diesel inventories remain tight globally. And as we look into '24, we anticipate that above-average turnaround activity globally in the first quarter, as well as the transition to summer gasoline blends, will be supportive of refining margins. As we look further into 2024, we believe the U.S.
refining industry will experience an enhanced midcycle environment due to global supply demand fundamentals and its relative advantages over international sources of supply, including energy costs, feedstock acquisition cost, and refinery complexity. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. These include, first, sustaining capital. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees, and support the communities in which we operate.
Second, our dividend. We're committed to paying a secure, competitive, and growing dividend. We intend to evaluate the dividend at least annually. Third, growth capital.
We will invest capital but be disciplined where we believe there are attractive returns, which will enhance our competitiveness and position MPC well into the future. Beyond these three objectives, we will return excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count. From May of '21 and through January 2024, we reduced our total share count by approximately 45%, repurchasing approximately 300 million shares at an average price of $97. As we execute in 2024, we remain committed to share repurchases as a key component of our capital allocation priorities.
MPC's stand-alone 2024 capital investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals $1.25 billion. Underpinning our commitment to safety and environmental performance, sustaining capital is approximately 35% of capital spend. In refining and marketing, gross spending is down nearly $200 million compared to 2023, reflecting strong capital discipline. In 2024, we are focused on investments that enhance margin and reduce costs.
In low carbon, we are investing in an opportunity that offers an attractive return, lowers our cost, increases reliability, and reduces emissions. This morning, MPLX also announced its 2024 capital investment plan of $1.1 billion, which is anchored in the Marcellus and Permian Basins. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann.
Maryann Mannen -- President
Thanks, Mike. Solid execution of our three strategic pillars remains foundational. We believe the improvements we've made to our cost structure, portfolio, and commercial execution have driven sustainable structural benefits, irrespective of the market environment. We will continue to build on this strong foundation to recognize value throughout our business.
Our refining utilization in 2023 was 92% as we operated our portfolio to meet consumer demand. Recently, we have said we believe our average capture over longer periods of time is approaching 100%. And in 2023, our full year capture was 100%. This commitment to commercial excellence is foundational, and we expect to continue to see these results.
While our capture results will fluctuate based on market dynamics, we believe that the capabilities we have built over the last few years and expect to enhance further will provide a sustainable advantage. Turning to our operations in the Gulf Coast. The Galveston Bay reformer repairs progressed as planned. We started the unit back up in mid-November and returned to full operating rates by mid-December.
At our Martinez facility, we will be operating at approximately 22,000 barrels per day in the short term. We have been working closely with the regulators to proceed with repairs to ensure safe and reliable operations. Let me move to Slide 7, which shows our capital investment plan for 2024 in a bit more detail. MPC's investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals $1.25 billion.
The plan includes $1.2 billion for refining and marketing segment. Our growth capital plan is approximately $825 million, but between traditional projects and low carbon. We are investing primarily at our large competitively advantaged facilities to enhance shareholder value and position MPC well into the future. Within traditional refining and marketing, $100 million is associated with a multiyear project to increase finished distillate yield at the Galveston Bay refinery; $375 million is focused on smaller projects targeted at enhancing yields at our refineries, improving energy efficiency, and lowering our costs, as well as investments in our branded marketing footprint.
Within low carbon, approximately $330 million is allocated to a multiyear infrastructure investment at our Los Angeles refinery, which will improve energy efficiency and lower facility emissions; and $20 million for smaller projects, focused on emerging opportunities. Slide 8 provides an overview of the multiyear investment at our Los Angeles refinery. The Los Angeles refinery is a core asset in our West Coast value chain and is one of the most competitive refineries in the region. This investment, once completed, is expected to further enhance its cost competitiveness by integrating and modernizing utility systems, which will improve reliability and increase energy efficiency.
Additionally, a portion of this improvement addresses a new regulation mandating further reductions in emissions. This regulation applies to all Southern California refineries. The improvements are expected to be completed by the end of 2025. We expect to generate a return on our investment of approximately 20%.
Turning to Slide 9. At Galveston Bay, we are investing to construct a 90,000-barrels-per-day high-pressure distillate hydrotreater. This project is planned to strengthen the competitiveness of the refinery through increased production of higher-value finished products. Once in service, the new distillate hydrotreater will upgrade high-sulfur distillate to ultra-low sulfur diesel, eliminating the need for third-party processing or sales into shrinking lower-value, high-sulfur export markets.
This strategic investment ensures we provide the clean burning fuels the world demands and further enhances the competitive position of our U.S. Gulf Coast value chain. The project is expected to be complete by year-end 2027 and generate a return of over 20%. Turning to our low-carbon initiatives.
We challenge ourselves to lead in sustainable energy by setting meaningful targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, methane emissions, and freshwater intensity targets, which we believe we can demonstrate a tangible pathway to accomplish. In our 2024 capital outlook, we are investing to significantly lower energy intensity and emissions at Los Angeles, one of our largest refineries. Additionally, we are investing small amounts of capital in early stage developments like RNG, which could significantly aid in greenhouse gas emission reductions in the future. Overall, we're taking disciplined steps to advance our goal to lower the carbon intensity of our operations and the products we manufacture, while continuing to supply a growing and evolving market by safely operating our current asset base with the objective to deliver superior cash flow.
Let me turn the call over to John.
John Quaid -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Maryann. Moving to fourth quarter highlights, Slide 11 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.98 for the fourth quarter and $23.63 for the full year. This quarter's results were adjusted to exclude the $0.14 per share net effect of three items: a $145 million LIFO inventory charge, $47 million of net recoveries related to MPLX's Garyville incident response, and a $92 million gain recognized by MPLX.
Adjusted EBITDA was over $3.5 billion for the quarter and almost $19 billion for the year. Cash flow from operations, excluding working capital changes, was nearly $2.3 billion for the quarter and $13.9 billion for the year. During the quarter, we returned $311 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased over $2.5 billion of our shares. Slide 12 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the third quarter to fourth quarter of 2023, as well as the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $2.2 billion, driven by lower R&M margins. The tax rate for the quarter was 18%, reflecting the impacts of the MPLX structure and a discrete benefit largely related to state taxes. For 2024, we expect our tax rate to be around 21%. Moving to our segment results.
Slide 13 provides an overview of our refining and marketing segment for the fourth quarter. Our 13 refineries ran at a 91% utilization, processing nearly 2.7 million barrels of crude per day. Sequentially, per-barrel margins were lower across all regions, driven by lower crack spreads. Capture for the quarter was 122%.
Refining operating costs were $5.67 per barrel in the fourth quarter, higher sequentially due to higher energy costs, particularly on the West Coast, as well as higher project-related expenses associated with planned turnaround activity. Slide 14 provides an overview of our refining and marketing margin capture of 122% for the quarter. We ran well, and our commercial teams executed effectively to deliver strong results. Capture this quarter benefited from light product margin tailwinds and particularly for jet fuel, as well as less of a headwind from secondary product prices.
Slide 15 shows the changes in our midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2023. Our midstream segment delivered strong fourth quarter results. For the full year 2023, our midstream segment EBITDA is up 7% compared to the prior year. Our midstream business is growing and generating strong cash flows as we advance high-return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus and Permian Basins.
Slide 16 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was nearly $2.3 billion in the quarter, driven by both our refining and midstream businesses. Working capital was a $1.1 billion use of cash for the quarter, driven primarily by declining crude prices. Cash from ops for the quarter was also impacted by a $320 million headwind from changes in our income tax receivable, which you might usually expect to see as a working capital change.
Capital expenditures and investments totaled $896 million this quarter. This includes MPLX's acquisition of full ownership of a gathering and processing joint venture in the Delaware Basin for approximately $270 million. MPC returned $2.8 billion via share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. This represents an approximate 125% payout of the $2.3 billion of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment to deliver superior shareholder returns.
As of January 26th, we have approximately $5.9 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. And at the end of the fourth quarter, MPC had approximately $10.2 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments, including approximately $1 billion of MPLX cash. Turning to guidance on Slide 17, we provide our first quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of almost 2.5 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 83%.
Utilization is forecasted to be lower than fourth quarter levels due mainly to higher turnaround activity. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $600 million. We are executing turnarounds at four of our largest refineries, Galveston Bay, Garyville, Los Angeles, and Robinson, all in the first quarter when margins are typically lower to minimize the financial impact of these outages. Turnaround expense for the full year is anticipated to be similar to last year at about $1.3 billion.
Operating costs in the first quarter are expected to be $5.85 per barrel, higher sequentially due mainly to lower throughput volumes associated with the significant planned turnaround activity. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.45 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $185 million. And with that, let me pass it back to Mike.
Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, John. We've delivered strong execution on our strategic commitments again this year. This includes running reliably with high utilization, structural improvements to our commercial performance, fostering a low-cost culture, and strengthening the competitive position of our assets. At MPLX, the partnership has continued to grow, increasing its cash flow and its cash distribution to MPC.
We've invested capital to grow earnings while exercising strict capital discipline. This has resulted in superior cash flow generation and supported the repurchase initiatives. Looking forward, we will continue to prioritize capital investments to ensure the safe and reliable performance of our assets, and we will also invest in projects where we believe there are attractive returns. We believe our focus on safety, environmental -- I'm sorry, operational excellence, and sustained commercial improvement will position us to capture this enhanced midcycle environment, which we expect to continue longer term given our advantages over marginal sources of supply and growing global demand.
MPC's midstream segment, consisting primarily of MPLX, has grown EBITDA by $1.3 billion since 2019, which is a 6% compound annual growth rate over the last four years. As MPLX continues to grow its free cash flow, we believe it's in a strong position to continue to consistently grow its distribution. As a result of MPLX increasing its distribution 10% over each of the last two years, MPC expects to receive $2.2 billion of cash distributions, which reflects a $400 million increase since 2020. Each 10% distribution increase is approximately $200 million of additional cash flow that MPC receives through its ownership in the partnership.
In summary, this year, we generated $14 billion of cash from operations, we increased our dividend 10%, repurchased $11.6 billion of shares, resulting in a 92% payout ratio. In 2023, MPC's total shareholder return was 31%. We believe MPC is positioned as the refiner investment of choice with the strongest through-the-cycle cash generation and the ability to deliver superior returns to our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back over to Kristina.
Kristina Kazarian -- Managing Director
Thanks, Mike. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will reprompt for additional questions. Sheila, we're ready.
Questions & Answers:

Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Neil Mehta -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Yeah. Good morning, Mike. Good morning, team. Thanks for doing this.
Great quarter. The first question is really on Slide 14, and this is what we're getting from investors this morning, which is the 122% system capture and that $885 million of margin uplift. And I recognize there are some sensitivities about what you can say and can't say here, but just can you talk about what drove that strength and how much of this feels one-time-ish versus stuff we want to carry forward?
Maryann Mannen -- President
Hey, Neil. Good morning. It's Maryann. Thanks for the question.
So, you know, first and foremost, as you know, commercial performance has been and will continue to be a foundational pillar for us in terms of delivering outstanding execution and meeting the goals and objectives that Mike shared with you around delivering best through-the-cycle cash flow throughout the cycles. In the quarter, we generated about 122% capture, as we shared. Overall, as you know, we've been talking about our ability to continue to drive toward 100%. Over the last couple of quarters, Rick and Brian have been sharing with you some of the key elements around structural changes that we believe are sustainable.
And then Mike announced this morning a couple of other changes which we think will continue to drive our ability to identify and deliver against that foundational principle. In the quarter, we had a couple of benefits that delivered the 122%. So, first of all, you know, strong light product margins and, frankly, a more favorable secondary products impact. You know, this is not abnormal for this period of time.
Having said that, you know, we also saw stronger jet fuel premiums to diesel and the benefit of diesel blending -- excuse me, of butane blending in the quarter as well. To your question, how much of this is repeatable? Obviously, some of those things are not repeatable, particularly when you look at the sharper drop in crude oil and refined product prices. We also did have the ability of having, as I shared with you, you know, our reformer at GBR and other benefits of projects that we completed fully operating in the quarter. So, let me pause there and see if that's -- that helps to answer your question at all.
Neil Mehta -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
That's great, Maryann. That's a lot of good color there. And the follow-up is just on Slide 17, sticking with the deck here, which is it does seem like a period of heavier turnaround in Q1, particularly in the West Coast region. Just maybe you could talk about, you know, the decision around where you took maintenance, how that fits into the full year plan, and anything we should be thinking about as you approach this turnaround season?
Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, Neil. It's Mike. Yeah, I think, you know, we said in our prepared remarks that our turnaround spend this year is about the same as last year. But the way you should think about it is, as, you know, Maryann mentioned, in the first quarter, we're pretty heavy at four of our largest facilities, our largest financial generating facility.
So, we're taking advantage of the fact that, you know, margins are down in the first quarter. So, we're spending 600 in the first quarter, which is a high number, you know, relative to the full year. And I know we don't traditionally give, you know, quarter to quarter, but I'll just tell you that, you know, next quarter, the turnaround number drops down to like 200 or so, somewhere in that range. So, you know, we're being opportunistic in some regard.
You know, a lot of the activity does get planned. But at the same time, you know, we want to take advantage of the fact that the margin environment now is constructive for us to be offline so that, you know, when margins, we think, are going to be a lot stronger in the second quarter, you know, we'll have our four largest facilities, you know, turned around and ready to deliver results.

Our next question will come from Manav Gupta with UBS. Your line is open.
Manav Gupta -- UBS -- Analyst
First of all, congrats, guys. I know one of the goals was to get to 100% capture. Although Mike always says to focus on EBITDA per barrel margin and free cash, I know one of the goals was to get to 100% capture, so congrats on overshooting that mark. My question here is on the two growth projects.
Los Angeles, some of the people out there are looking to exit the state given the tougher laws. You are actually going back and investing in this project, so help us understand what's driving that. And again, on the Galveston Bay moving from, you know, upgrading high-sulfur to ULSD, what kind of realization uplift could you get if you do execute this project?
Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, Manav. This is Mike. I'll start. First of all, thank you for the comment on capture, and as you said, it's not my favorite metric, but, you know, I'm a big believer in how much cash are we generating, how much cash per share are we generating.
And I want to lead in those categories is the metric that I spend the most time, you know, looking at. But it does give some good indication, as Maryann said. It's hard just to differentiate, you know, the question Neil asked between what's happening in the market and, you know, what are some of the structural improvements that we've implemented over the last couple of years here. But anyway, thanks for the comment.
As far as our capital investment, I'm hoping everybody sees a couple of things. You know, one is, yes, we are investing in our LA facility. It's an area where we believe that we can put a decent amount of investment in there and really improve the competitiveness of that facility. But we already believe it's, you know, one of the top facilities, you know, on the West Coast.
So, it is an area that we want to invest in. Now, that particular investment is about efficiency, reliability, and lowering our cost. And to your point, you know, being a very reliable supplier out there is an important part of the equation. The other project that we've announced is a margin enhancement project.
And in our view, you know, things are not going to get easier for unhydrotreated distillate into the future. And if you look at the spreads today, even today, they're pretty wide. So, at the end of the day, what's driving us the most in both of those when we put this in the slides is we think both of these projects are north of 20% returns. And hopefully, we're conservative on that, but we think they're very good investments.
And again, in two of our largest, highest financial generating facilities. So, one of the themes that you've heard from us is we're going to invest in projects that we feel really strong about on a return basis, but they're also enhancing the competitive positions of some of our biggest facilities. And I think you've heard the theme from us for a while here. It's margin enhancement, lower costs, and efficiencies.
And out on the West Coast, the other driver is, you know, there's an emissions reduction goals that are going to occur over time, and this project will take care of that in a large way. And that's why we grouped it into our low-carbon area. So, hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color.
Manav Gupta -- UBS -- Analyst
Perfect. My quick follow-up here is you were looking to ramp toward the nameplate capacity at your renewable diesel project on the West Coast. If you can give us some update over there. How is that project progressing?
Maryann Mannen -- President
Certainly. It's Maryann. Currently, we are running at about 22,000 barrels a day, versus our nameplate at 48,000. We're going to continue to run at that level as we work with the regulators to determine what repairs need to be complete in order to be able to get to that nameplate at 48,000.
You know, as we think about that, as you know, we've got our JV partnership with Neste. So, you know, really, what we're looking at is the differential for MPC of about 13,000 barrels a day. So, you know, not meaningful to the, you know, 3 million barrel system that we run. But again, running at 22,000 overall for the facility, and we'll continue to work with our regulators to determine when we can bring it to full 48,000.
Manav Gupta -- UBS -- Analyst

Thank you. Next, we will hear from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Securities. You may proceed.
Doug Leggate -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Mike, I hate to do this, I wonder if I could try to capture a question in a slightly different way because we, I guess, have a slightly different view of this. If we look at your system as more of an LP, we see a great deal of linearity between the indicator margin and what you're delivering.
I think I agree with you. I think capture is a terrible metric to try and measure a linear program business, frankly. But what we do see, however, is that the mix of inputs seems to be changing some, which is allowing you to capture more of the margin. So, my question is really that.
What are you doing in your commercial business or operations that is changing the optimization of the slate that you're running in your system? Obviously, there are a lot of moving parts around crude in the U.S. right now with TMX and a few other things. Is that a factor?
Rick Hessling -- Chief Commercial Officer
Yeah. Hi, Doug. This is Rick. So, I'll take a stab at that.
So, we are significantly -- I would say, every day, Doug, we are optimizing our slate. And we look at this regionally. We look at this by plant. But in the end, Doug, I think what we do better than others in the industry is we optimize for the betterment of our total return at the end of the day.
So, we are not -- we could sub-optimize one plant for the benefit of another, and we have worked years, decades, as a matter of fact, to give ourselves optionality within our mid-con system. We are currently juggling optionality with TMX and our West Coast and Pacific Northwest system, as well as we've worked on it for quite a while on the Gulf Coast. So, you are onto something from a crude slate perspective. It's constantly changing.
We're constantly pushing the norm on what we should run, what crudes we look at, what assays we look at, updating our system. So, this is just an ongoing exercise that's been happening now for several years now. And I've said it before, we're unpacking everything from A to Z, Doug. We're leaving no rock unturned in terms of capturing value.
And that not only goes certainly on the crude slate side, but it goes throughout our entire value chain.
Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Doug. It's Mike. I know it's been a source of frustration since we don't give a lot of detail in this area, you know, for competitive reasons, but to Rick's point, you know, we've made some changes. And to be honest with you, I'm more excited about what's in the future for us.
You know, Brian's new role as head of global optimization for us, I think, is going to, you know, make a step change for where we're going. So, we've had a lot of momentum in this area, and, you know, it's showing up in the results. As we discussed, you know, capture is not my favorite, but generating cash is. And at the end of the day, I think we have more opportunity in the whole area.
You know, if we run well and then deliver commercially, we'll continue to generate cash and be a good source of return for shareholders.
Doug Leggate -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
LPs are a complicated beast, and you guys seem to have figured it out. So, thank you for the answer, guys. My follow-up is probably for -- maybe for Maryann. I'm not sure.
Congratulations, everyone, in their new roles. But, Maryann, if I look at Slide 21, you're showing your debt maturity profile at the MPC level, obviously, you know, sitting with a net cash position at the MPC level. What are your thoughts on where you want your balance sheet to be as those debt maturities come due?
John Quaid -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Hey. Good morning, Doug. It's John.
I'll go ahead and take that one.
Doug Leggate -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Thanks, John. I wasn't sure if you'd take it or not. Thank you.
John Quaid -- Chief Financial Officer
No, no, no. Not a problem at all. And I think you kind of were hinting at it as you were getting there. We've got a lot of financial flexibility right now.
We're very comfortable with the gross amount of debt that MPC has, but certainly have the balance sheet to be very thoughtful about the right timing of refinancing that debt and really optimizing our cost of capital and really that cost of debt. And I think longer term, right, we've laid out a target of kind of the gross debt to cap at 25% to 30%. We're a good bit a ways from that, but that's something we'll continue to monitor as we look out into the future.
Doug Leggate -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
And, John, remind me, is that consolidated for MPLX or stand-alone?
John Quaid -- Chief Financial Officer
It's stand-alone.
Doug Leggate -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
OK. Great. Thank you very much.
John Quaid -- Chief Financial Officer
MPLX is in a much different position. I can probably speak to that one pretty well given the seat I was in before where you've got a really stable company running at, you know, sub-3.5% leverage. But the cash flows there can probably support a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of four times. Again, they've got some financial flexibility to be smart about what they're doing as well.
So, I think both balance sheets are in a really strong place.
Doug Leggate -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Paul Cheng -- Scotiabank -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Good morning.
Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Paul.
Paul Cheng -- Scotiabank -- Analyst
Mike, I think in the past, you have shown that you are not really interested in acquisition of refining assets. But one can argue that, I mean, given how well you are running your facility, do you think that there's a value to be added if you have some additional assets to your platform so you can apply your technical know-how to even a bigger profile? And also, in the Gulf Coast, you have two huge refinery. If we add additional facility, would that further diversify and reduce the operating risk, having multiple facility. And also, frankly, that will perhaps even increase the commercial and optimization opportunities.
So, just want to see that. I mean, how you guys look at that questions internally?
Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, Paul. First off, you know, Dave Heppner's group is constantly looking at the market and what assets are available. I always say never say never. But in the meantime, you know, while Dave is working on that side of the equation, we're also looking at the footprint we have in the assets we have, and that's part of the reason that we came out with the announcement today.
You know, two of our key facilities we think we can make a meaningful change. And we've been more transparent than normal to try and explain to people, you know, we think we got north of 20% return projects here on the assets that we own ourselves. So, there's always a balance, Paul, between, obviously, the assets you own, you know inside and out, whereas the ones you're evaluating externally, there's a little bit of, you know, concern from diligence, etc. But I will tell you, you know, I think people know my DNA, in general, but at the same time, you know, Dave and his team are challenging, you know, where can we make investments that are outside of our portfolio.
We haven't done a lot, as you mentioned, on the refining side, but we have made some investments, you know, in what we're calling low carbon. You know, we've made some investments in some pre-treat facilities on the low-carbon side. We've invested in our RNG facilities. So, Dave and his team are looking at both refining and outside of refining and we just, you know, constantly talk about that and decide where do we think we want to put our capital.
And for right -- for today, we were pleased to report that we think we have two pretty good projects. But the other part -- let me just mention this one last thing because this is kind of important. On this slide where we talk about our capital, we say in traditional refining, we're investing 475 million. Maryann mentioned that 100 million of that is related to the DHT project.
But 375 million of that is what we don't typically talk about on earnings calls. These are projects in all of our facilities that are higher return, really good projects for us, but they don't have the sexy headline about them. But if you look at it, though, 375 out of the 475 in traditional are these smaller, high-return projects. So, you know, the team does a nice job.
You know, Tim and his organization are constantly looking for areas where we can make margin improvement, lower costs, increase reliability. And as you said, you know, this all starts with you got to run reliably and then you've got to be smart commercially, and I think we've demonstrated that a little bit, and then we just try to invest capital to keep bolstering, you know, that equation. So, hopefully, that gives you a little more color.
Paul Cheng -- Scotiabank -- Analyst
Absolutely. Can I just go back into the commercial question? In the fourth quarter, you guys definitely done well and you [Inaudible] And if we're looking at versus the margin capture, the 100%, the additional 22%, is there a number that you can share, how much of that is coming from the commercial side of the business that you have done really well and that's why that you are seeing that much better in the capture? And also that I think in the past, you're saying that one of the maybe Holy Grail for commercial operations is that you will be able to optimize based on breakdown design and optimize based on the total company. Where we in that process? Do you think that you're already there or that you're just still scratching the surface on that process?
Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Paul, I'll start with the second part. As I said, I'll repeat myself a little bit, but we still think there's quite a ways to go where we can do better, and that was part of the reasoning behind the organizational change. You know, Brian's role as global optimization lead is going to -- his team is going to work with the commercial guys, with our refining guys.
And you heard me say redefine process, find places to invest, change what we're doing today. So, I think we've made a lot of progress. You know, people always ask, you know, what inning, or I guess it's football season, so what quarter are we in? And that's always hard to ascertain because I think we keep, you know, peeling the onion back and seeing that we can make another step change. So, I'm optimistic that we got a lot of road to go.
And I think at the end of the day, you know, our mantra is, you know, just keep watching our results, and you'll see the -- you know, what comes out of it. As far as the first part, it's always hard. That's why I'm not the biggest fan of that metric. It's always hard to differentiate some of the market factors that Maryann mentioned.
Obviously, in the fourth quarter, you get butane blending, you know, as one thing that, you know, enhances capture. But there is a significant -- if I want to give some kudos to our team, there is a significant change in the way we're approaching the business. You know, you heard from Rick earlier. And so, I think it is additive to whatever the market's given us.
And my thought is the way we have to run the company is, you know, we don't control the margin environment, but whatever margin environment is given to us, you know, we just got to deliver more results and generate more cash and more cash per share. So, while everybody outside and inside wants to talk about that capture metric, I just keep looking at the one that matters the most to me.
Paul Cheng -- Scotiabank -- Analyst
Thank you.
Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer
You're welcome.
Maryann Mannen -- President
Hey, Paul. It's Maryann. I just might try to add a bit more around some of the things that we're doing specifically around commercial performance without necessarily trying to give you a percentage. But, you know, we've been talking over the last several quarters about the capabilities we've built regionally, obviously, at the Houston Office, at the Singapore office, the London office, that has helped us.
You know, Doug was laughingly saying to Mike about, you know, cracking the code on linear programming. But, you know, some of the capabilities that Rick and Brian and their respective teams have built historically give us very robust tools and data analytics that allow us to assess the decisions that we've made and know how good or bad those decisions were and what we might do with that to change it. So, it is building -- these capabilities are building, you know, sustainable learnings and capabilities in the organization that we think will continue to drive our performance. I hope that's a bit more helpful, too.
Paul Cheng -- Scotiabank -- Analyst

Next, we will hear from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.
Roger Read -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Yeah. Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter.
Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Roger.
Roger Read -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Maybe just if we could address the changes here on the management team and whether or not that portend -- or what it does portend about the future. I know, Mike, you're approaching the point at which the board has to make a decision to extend, if I understood correctly from the meetings back in late November. So, anything you can offer us up on any updates there?
Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, Roger. I'll start off with, you know, the changes are driven by two things. You know, results. You know, one of the things that I feel my responsibility is to reward the results that we're getting because the team has done a very nice effort across the whole team.
And the second part is development. You know, putting people in positions such that they grow more personally so that they can contribute to the team. So, you know, both of those factors, I think, played into a lot of these assessments that occurred at the executive level, but it's also occurring, you know, below that and not everybody gets to see. So, I'm a big believer in the team approach.
You know, practically all decisions that we make, all of our team is involved in. So, you know, there's a heavy component of development on top of, you know, the results that have occurred the last couple of years. You know, as far as me personally, you know, I think you've heard in the past, that's a board decision. The board's very aware of that.
You know, that'll play itself out in time. But boards, you know, if it's not their top priority, it's, you know, obviously at the very top of the first couple of what their responsibility is. So, that's just a work in progress. It's been in progress for quite some time, and, you know, it'll play itself out as time goes by.
Roger Read -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
OK. And then my other question was to follow up a little bit on the balance sheet question I think Doug asked about -- in debt to cap guidance given. But if you keep buying shares back, theoretically you could end up shrinking the equity side, which could get you to the 25%, even if you held debt flat. So, none of us can predict the future exactly where all this will shake out, but would that sort of math imply that you could actually end up, you know, staying at the same debt level? In other words, simply refinance the debt, implying that all the cash that's on there would be eligible for share repurchases or some other sort of return to shareholders and that's the right math to follow?
John Quaid -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Hey, Roger. It's John. You read through my subtle comments very, very well.
And certainly, the other part of that equation, right, is what we're doing on the equity side. So, that was my comment. Hey, we were -- we think our gross levels of debt are appropriate as we look forward because that'll be part of the math. We'll take a look at that, but I think you're pretty spot on.
I'm not sure I can add much from what you said, to be honest.
Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Roger, the only thing I would add is -- I'm sorry, I just wanted to just add. As a general rule, you know, my belief is, you know, we don't want to be under-levered. We don't want to be over-levered.
You know, we want to find what we think is the appropriate level, and we think we've been there and we've been consistent there, and that's why people should read into our cash position as, you know, that's going to be targeted for return to shareholders. You know, I think our job is to generate the most cash we can; run the balance sheet properly, which, you know, we've done over the past; and then at the end of the day, return excess capital to shareholders.
Roger Read -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Thank you. Our next question will come from John Royall with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
John Royall -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, I just had a follow-up on the balance sheet.
You had another strong quarter for the buyback at 2.5 billion. But with the crack environment turning down, you did end up drawing almost 3 billion of cash. And despite the big maintenance coming up in 1Q, it looks like January is off to a really healthy pace at 900 million. So, my question is would you expect to maintain a similar pace throughout 1Q as you progress these turnarounds and what could that mean for the cash draw and where balances could be at the end of 1Q?
John Quaid -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Hey. Good morning, John. It's John here.
I'll take that one and let Mike add some other comments as well. But let me just start by saying as I roll into this seat, I want to be clear, there's no change in how we're viewing return of capital, as you heard even in Mike's prepared remarks. Again, really strong performance last year again as we're looking to drive strong returns to our investors. And that'll continue to be a key part of our capital allocation priorities in 2024.
And as we look at that, we're going to look at lots of things. One, we want to be opportunistic in the overall capital allocation, and we'll consider the refining macro environment, along with lots of other items, but -- and the balance sheet and where it is. But ultimately, I just want to be clear, we're going to be steadfast in our commitment to return of capital.
Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer
And, John, it's Mike. The only thing that I'll add is, you know, we think it's part of our DNA and duty to return capital as part of our mantra. So, you know, we've been saying for quite some time and we've been fortunate, as you said, you know, the margin environment has been, you know, conducive to generating more cash. But we've targeted all along to, you know, return that capital to shareholders.
We're going to continue to do that. And then again, whatever market environment we get handled -- or get handed, I'm sorry, we will -- we'll make that still a priority for us. It's on our capital allocation priority. You know, we'll start off with maintaining the assets, growing the dividend, investing in the business.
So, that's still, you know, part of our DNA as well. But at the end, I'm a huge believer of give that capital back to shareholders and then let shareholders decide where they want to invest longer term. We want to be the vehicle where we generate cash and return capital. And as people have seen that over time, you know, that isn't going to change regardless of what the margin environment is.
John Royall -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Great. Thank you. And then I apologize ahead of time to Mike for this, but I do have another question on capture, but, you know, the commercial stuff aside. Can you help us think about some of the moving pieces in the first quarter and particularly how should we think about the impact of the heavy maintenance in the quarter? Is this still, you know, potential to be a 100%-type quarter given you have so much maintenance, and any other moving pieces that we should think about that might move you away from that 100% in either direction in 1Q?
Maryann Mannen -- President
Hey, John. It's Maryann, and let me see if I can take that for you and address your question. So, you know, first and foremost, as we say, we continue to think, for 2024, our objective is to drive toward that 100%. You're absolutely right.
In the quarter, as we said, we've got about 600 million. But, you know, we're touching crude units, so we're not expecting a significant amount of negative impact on our capture, you know, despite the fact that, you know, we are seeing, you know, that level of turnaround. Now, as you know, we do have variables, you know, that impact the capture rate from quarter to quarter. But right now, we are not expecting turnaround to have a substantially negative impact on that drive toward 100%.
John Royall -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst

Our next question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is open.
Theresa Chen -- Barclays -- Analyst
Hi. I wanted to ask about the outlook from a product supply perspective, just so on the domestic front, there does seem to be a good amount of planned work this quarter, including within your own system, which should be constructive for inventories going to summer. But internationally, there is quite a bit of new supply coming online, and one of your competitors has, you know, talked about a 1.5 million barrels per day number. Would you agree with that and how much do you think, you know, could be realistically utilized?
Rick Hessling -- Chief Commercial Officer
Hi, Theresa. This is Rick. I'll attack the new refining capacity first. So, we see that coming on later versus sooner.
And when I say later, I would say second half of this year and then some. You know, over the years, when you bring on new greenfield facilities, which are being brought on, it's been proven difficult to bring them on in a timely fashion. And these specific facilities, like others, will face challenges with logistics and supply. So, I won't specifically comment on the 1.5, but I will say we believe it'll be later versus earlier.
And then for the demand piece specifically, certainly you've seen, as you referenced, utilization even here recently down 7% in the last week due to turnarounds and weather-related events. When we look at that and look going forward, we're continuing to see steady demand. As Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, our export book on gas and diesel has been very solid. It was solid in 2023, and we're off to a very good start in '24.
So, when we look at all of this together, we see it setting up very well, Theresa, for a very supportive spring and summer season.
Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer
Theresa, it's Mike. I'll just add. I mean, it's pretty well documented. I mean, last year, oil demand globally was over 2 million barrels a day.
I know some of the forecasters are calling it, you know, one-plus-ish. You know, we'll see how that plays itself out for this year. But I think the bigger picture, even though, you know, there's been a lot of attention, particularly to these two refineries that are, you know, coming up, as Rick mentioned, later in the year, the reason we believe it's more constructive over time is we're still believers in demand is going to continue to rise. And absent this short-term issue with, you know, some of the supply coming on, we just see it very constructive where demand is going to continue to outpace.
And that's why we think margins will stay, you know, in an above midcycle is the term everybody's using. I think at the end of the day, you know, we'll obviously keep a watch out. And there may be some short-term, you know variations to that. But I think part of the reason that we remain bullish is if we look over time, we're just big believers in demand is going to stay robust.
And on paper, aside from the short-term issue, we don't see a whole lot of supply response trying to match that. Hopefully, that makes sense to you.

Thank you. Our next question will come from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Ryan Todd -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
Good. Thanks. Maybe as a follow-up on that last question, you -- in your prepared remarks, I mean, you mentioned that you -- what you view as an enhanced midcycle environment for U.S. refineries in the coming years.
I mean, I think you were just talking about some of the broader global supply and demand that I think would feed into that. But can you maybe talk a little bit more about what you view as the primary drivers of that uplift to margins, particularly for U.S. refiners? And when you think about the go-forward environment versus -- go-forward midcycle versus past mid-cycle, you know, do you -- what sort of uplift can -- you know, do you think about $1 a barrel, $2 a barrel? Is there -- and, you know -- and how do you underpin that in terms of kind of U.S. advantages for you and your system?
Rick Hessling -- Chief Commercial Officer
Yeah, Ryan. It's Rick. So, for U.S. advantages, they're quite significant.
You know, Mike touched on early on in his prepared remarks, we have a feedstock advantage here in North America, with feedstock at our doorstep, and we have access to crude from around the world. So, we believe that's a significant advantage. And it's been very well documented, we have an energy advantage with the U.S. being extremely long in nat gas and we have cheap nat gas prices.
But in addition to that, when we look at our workforce and our assets and our refinery complexity, when you start layering all of those on top of one another, Ryan, it adds up significantly to an advantage, which is why Mike referenced earlier we believe in an enhanced midcycle. Now, when you think of it from our perspective, this is where our scale really comes into play. So, we run a billion barrel a system -- a billion barrel system annually. So, you can pick the number.
We won't give you a number, but it's easy math. If it's midcycle plus a buck that adds $1 billion to MPC's bottom line. A two-buck incentive or enhancement over midcycle, 2 billion. So, that's where our scale really comes into play.
Now, we are bullish because of a lot of the reasons Mike mentioned. Global demand, we believe, will hit a record consumption in '24. '23 was a record. We believe '24 will be a record.
IEA believes '24 will be a record. In fact, IEA continues to revise up their demand forecasts month after month and have done so for the last three months. In addition, we referenced turnarounds. Globally, turnarounds are high when you're looking at history, and we are set up well here for a strong spring and summer.
I hope that helps you.
Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Ryan. It's Mike. Let me just add. You know, we don't pick a number.
We do scenario planning, you know, like Rick gave you some examples. But -- so we do scenario planning, what if it's two bucks, what if it's four bucks, what if it's six bucks, and take a look at it from that perspective rather than trying to estimate what the number is. I'm a big believer and it's hard to call the 50-yard line, but if we get the banks of the river, we get the two end zones, right? You know, then we'll be able to run the business properly for the long term.
Operator
And we do have time for just one more question. Our last question will come from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Jason Gabelman -- TD Cowen -- Analyst
Yeah. Hey. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in.
I wanted to ask about the West Coast project that you disclosed today and a two-part question on it. First, when you reference the returns, how much? Is there a decent chunk of that that's related to avoided regulatory penalties that you would incur if you didn't do the project? And then how do you get comfortable with the demand outlook on the West Coast and the potential regulations that can limit MPC's ability to capture periods where product prices are higher?
Mike Hennigan -- Chief Executive Officer
So, Jason, on the -- on your first part, there's nothing that you said was avoiding costs or whatever. So, nothing's related to that. So, it's a -- you know, think of it as a reliability project, a modernization project, an efficiency project, a lower-cost project, and reducing greenhouse gas, which we need to do out there. There's regulations out there that are going to occur over time.
You know, we could have made the choice to wait until that regulatory requirement was there, but we saw an opportunity to enhance the facility ahead of time. And we've kind of disclosed already, we think there's greater than 20% return there. You know, how do we get comfortable, you know, in the overall macro? It's -- there's going to be a tough environment for California if things get, you know, more and more competitive out there, but we think we have a very competitive asset. So, we think we're in it for the long term.
We don't think all the facilities out there will survive in the long term. But as that volatility occurs out there, we want to have a really, you know, strong competitive, reliable, efficient, low-cost facility.
Rick Hessling -- Chief Commercial Officer
Jason, I'll just add to that. We believe our integrated system in California is a competitive advantage over the merchant refiner as well. So, when you look across our entire value chain, from feedstocks and all the way through to the station level, that's a competitive advantage over the merchant refinery when you have demand declines.

With the required preliminaries out of the way, I will begin with a review of our results for the fourth quarter and full year, give an overview of our 2024 guidance, then turn the call over to Joe Craft, our chairman, president, and chief executive officer, for his comments. During 2023, we delivered another record full year in terms of revenues, coal sales price per ton, oil and gas royalty volumes, and net income. We accomplished these records in a challenging year for the global economy, pressured by high interest rates, global geopolitical unrest, and continued volatility in commodity prices. Operationally, we had to contend with reduced volumes across the Appalachia region, primarily caused by lower recoveries, fewer operating units at MC Mining, and challenging geologic conditions that delayed development of a new district at our Mettiki longwall operation.
Notwithstanding these obstacles, we achieved our outstanding results through a combination of our well-contracted order book, tight focus on operating efficiencies, and investment for longer-term strategic positioning with our customers. Full year revenues were 2.6 billion, an increase from 2.4 billion in 2022. Net income was 630.1 million, up from 586.2 million. And earnings per unit increased nearly 10% from $4.39 in 2022 to $4.81 in 2023.
Looking more closely at the fourth quarter comparisons, total revenues were 625.4 million in the 2023 quarter, compared to 704.2 million in the 2022 quarter. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by lower coal prices, lower oil and gas prices, and reduced coal sales volumes in Appalachia, which more than offset record oil and gas royalty volumes and higher transportation and other revenues. Total coal sales price per ton was $60.60 for the 2023 quarter, a decrease of 10.7% versus the 2022 quarter. Softer demand in both domestic and international markets resulting from a mild start to winter and lower natural gas prices negatively impacted coal pricing.
This was partially offset by the positive impacts of our contracted order book. On a sequential basis, coal sales price per ton was 6.7% lower. As it relates to volumes, total coal production of 7.9 million tons was 6.6% lower compared to the 2022 quarter, while coal sales volumes decreased 7.5% to 8.6 million tons compared to the 2022 quarter. Illinois Basin coal sales volumes increased by 2.1% and 6.1% compared to the 2022 and sequential quarters, respectively.
The increase is the result of higher volumes from our Hamilton and Warrior mines compared to the 2022 quarter and from our Gibson South operations sequentially. Coal sales volumes in Appalachia were down 27.4% and 8.8%, respectively, compared to the 2022 and sequential quarters. The reduced volumes across the region was primarily caused by lower recoveries, reduced operating units at MC Mining, a scheduled longwall move at our Tunnel Ridge mine, and challenging geologic conditions at our Mettiki longwall operation that delayed the development of a new longwall district. Additionally, 2023 quarter coal inventory and tons sold were negatively impacted by approximately 0.6 million tons due to an unexpected temporary outage at a third-party Gulf Coast export terminal we use for export market sales.
In our royalties segments, total revenues were 53 million in the 2023 quarter, down 1.9% year over year, but essentially unchanged sequentially. The year-over-year decrease in revenues reflects lower realized oil and gas commodity pricing that more than offset record oil and gas volumes and increases in coal royalty revenue per ton. Specifically, coal royalty revenue per ton was up 24.3% compared to the 2022 quarter, while lower commodity prices led to oil and gas royalties average realized sales prices being down 19.7% per BOE versus the 2022 quarter. Sequentially, coal royalty revenue per ton was 0.9% lower and oil and gas royalties average sales prices were up 0.9% per BOE.
Oil and gas royalty volumes increased 13.1% on a BOE basis to a new record, while coal royalty tons sold declined 5.4% year over year. The record volumes from oil and gas resulted from increased drilling and completion activities on our interests and acquisitions of additional oil and gas mineral interests. Turning to costs. Segment adjusted EBITDA expense per ton sold for our co-operations was $42.91, an increase of 7.9% and 4.2% versus the 2022 and sequential quarters, respectively.
The impacts of lower volumes I just discussed in Appalachia and higher-cost purchased coal more than offset improvements in the Illinois Basin. Specifically, the Illinois Basin saw higher volumes and lower expenses at the Hamilton mine as compared to the 2022 quarter when the facility experienced an unexpected outage that lasted four weeks. Last quarter, we gave additional color to our Appalachian longwall operation at Mettiki. It was in -- it was idle for the entire third quarter and into the fourth quarter but returned to production in late December.
In 2024, we expect to move the longwall again, skipping over a region of adverse geology, and resume production under much more favorable mining conditions in March. This is expected to benefit overall production volumes and cost in Appalachia in 2024 when compared to the back half of 2023, which is reflected in the guidance I will discuss in a moment. Our net income in the 2023 quarter was 115.4 million, 46.8% lower as compared to the 2022 quarter. The decrease reflects the previously discussed lower coal sales volumes and realized prices, higher production expenses, and lower realized prices in oil and gas royalties, partially offset by higher coal royalty sales price per ton realizations and record volumes in oil and gas royalties.
EBITDA for the quarter was 185.4 million, down 37.6% as compared to the 2022 quarter. Now, turning to our balance sheet and uses of cash. Alliance generated free cash flow for the full year 2023 of 421.6 million. During the 2023 quarter, we completed two acquisitions of mineral interests, totaling 24.8 million, for 3,236 net royalty acres in the Permian, Anadarko, and Williston basins.
Additionally, during the 2023 quarter, we paid a quarterly distribution of $0.70 per unit, equating to an annualized rate of $2.80 per unit. This distribution level is unchanged sequentially and as compared to the 2022 quarter. Lastly, we reduced our debt outstanding by 22.9 million, resulting in total and net leverage ratios of 0.37 and 0.31 times, respectively, total debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Total liquidity was 492.1 million at year-end, which included 59.8 million of cash on the balance sheet.
Turning to our initial guidance detailed in this morning's release. 2024 is shaping up to be a solid year for our ARLP, with a well-contracted order book and the opportunity to flex additional export tons should market conditions warrant the move. As you will notice, we have provided some additional color to our outlook by detailing both estimated realized pricing and cost per ton by region. Our expected realized full year 2024 price is based on a combination of our contracted order book and our expectations for additional contracting, both domestic and export, for the open position.
We expect the logistic issues that pressured the second half of 2023, including low river system water levels and an extended outage at the third-party export terminal we utilize in the Gulf of Mexico, to no longer impact 2024 results. We anticipate ARLP's overall coal sales volumes in 2024 to be in a range of 34 million to 35.8 million tons, with over 90% of these volumes committed and priced at attractive levels, similar to the 2023 average realized pricing. Specifically, our committed tonnage for 2024 is 32.5 million tons, including 28.4 million domestically and 4.1 million to the export markets. Coal sales prices in the Illinois Basin are expected to range between $54.50 and $56 per ton, compared to $55.21 per ton in 2023; and in Appalachia, in the range of $80.50 to $83.50 per ton, compared to $86.98 per ton sold in 2023.
On the cost side, we expect full year 2024 segment adjusted EBITDA expense per ton in the Illinois Basin to be in a range of $35.25 to $37.25 per ton, as compared to $34.84 in 2023; and in Appalachia, $54.25 to $57.25 per ton, as compared to $53.15 per ton in 2023. During the full year 2024, we have three scheduled longwall moves at Hamilton, three at Tunnel Ridge, and two at Mettiki, with one of the moves at Mettiki and one at Hamilton scheduled in March. In our oil and gas royalties segment, we expect sales of 1.4 million to 1.5 million barrels of oil, 5.6 million to 6 million MCF of natural gas, and 675,000 to 725,000 barrels of liquid. Segment adjusted EBITDA expense is expected to be approximately 12% of oil and gas royalties revenues for the year.
In 2024, we are anticipating 450 million to 500 million in total capital expenditures. Consistent with messaging in recent quarters, 2023 and 2024 are years of elevated capital expenditures as we make long-term strategic investments in our River View, Warrior, Hamilton, and Tunnel Ridge mines to ensure they remain reliable, low-cost operations for many years to come. Starting in 2025, we anticipate our capital expenditures to return to more normalized levels of $6.75 to $7.75 per ton produced. Additionally, we remain committed to investing in our oil and gas minerals business.
The amount of which will be dependent upon the opportunities available that meet our underwriting standards. Next, we remain focused on continuing to improve our balance sheet, maintaining flexibility and strong liquidity. We expect to retire the 285 million outstanding on our senior notes periodically throughout the balance of 2024 using a combination of operating cash flows and a number of attractive financing options currently available to us, including increases to our existing facilities, equipment financings, and utilizing the collateral value of our high-quality and unencumbered royalty assets, all of which are at various stages of execution today. Thereafter, we will continue to evaluate the highest return and best use of excess cash flow.
This includes returning capital to our unitholders in the form of cash distributions or unit repurchases and accretive growth opportunities that extend beyond our base business. With that, I will turn the call over to Joe for comments on the market and his outlook for ARLP. Joe.
Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Cary, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin my comments by thanking and congratulating the entire Alliance organization for their resilience, continued hard work, and dedication for delivering another record year for total revenue, realized pricing per ton sold, oil and gas royalty volumes, and net income. Cary did an excellent job summarizing our 2023 results and outlining our guidance for the upcoming year, as well as explaining the factors that contributed to our success in 2023. As we looked at 2024, our coal sales book is expected to be equally as strong as last year and be the anchor to deliver another solid year of revenue.
Our dependability and the reliability of our coal quality are highly valued by our customers, evidenced by the premium pricing we have received relative to the spot market on recent commitments with domestic customers for multiyear contracts. We are entering 2024 with over 90% of our coal sales volumes committed and priced at similar levels relative to 2023. We are expecting our production to be more consistent than 2023, believing we have moved beyond the several negative geologic areas that we faced this past year. As we think about the outlook for the coal industry and the markets we serve, several key themes emerge, underscoring the critical need for reliable, affordable baseload fuel for electric generation.
The first relates to increasing market expectations for nationwide energy demand. Over the past year, we should all take notice that grid planners have nearly doubled five-year load growth forecasts in support of ongoing investment in U.S. industrial and manufacturing sectors, as well as citing rising energy needs associated with data centers and artificial intelligence. While the speed of electrifying the transportation sector may have slowed, the enthusiasm for AI has accelerated.
The power demand requirements for data center cannot be understated, highlighted by recent estimates that electric demand from operational and announced data centers in the U.S. will reach over 30 gigawatts in the coming years, with some individual sites needing upwards of 600 megawatts of power. These increased revisions are not temporary fluctuations but represent fundamental changes to energy consumption patterns. Just last week, the governor of Indiana announced Facebook parent, Meta, will build an $800 million data center on a 600-acre site in Jeffersonville, Indiana, across the river from Louisville, Kentucky.
And the governor said that his state aims to be the AI capital of the Midwest, while Kentucky's governor for several years has declared Kentucky as the undisputed electric battery production capital of the United States of America. Both of these messages suggest more to come. More proof to support our belief that load growth in our key markets will be exceptionally strong over this decade. Furthermore, we are observing a renewed emphasis in urgency by regulatory bodies such as FERC and NERC to ensure power grid reliability, a fundamental attribute coal-fired generation provides.
In the markets we serve, regulators, elected officials, and leaders focused on economic development. Our evaluating actions needed to ensure reliable electricity capacity is available to meet this growing electric demand, especially in peak times. Impacts from weather time and time again display the weakness of the grid domestically and, unfortunately, at times, the danger to consumers. Two weeks ago, after what was a relatively mild start to this winter, the U.S.
experienced a cold snap in which over three-quarters of the country was exposed to below-freezing temperatures, and hundreds of thousands were without power. From Texas to the eastern United States, winter demand approached record levels, and the state's grid operators asked for consumers to curb consumption due to a capacity shortage. It is times like that when wind turbines are often unable to turn and natural gas pipelines can be constrained in their ability to deliver, that the grid is tested, and failure can have catastrophic consequences. Having this strategic flexibility of coal on the ground elevates the service and reliability we provide to unmatched levels.
It is for reasons similar to these that we believe the U.S. will continue to see delays and extensions in the premature closure of critical coal plants and why we are committed to serve these markets for many years to come. Over the past year, utilities have extended the plant operating life of approximately 10 gigawatts of coal generating capacity as a result of increasing electricity demand and delays in the construction of replacement generation, particularly renewables. We acknowledge the U.S.
grid will evolve with time, but policy decision-makers must be responsible and practical in doing so and currency policy needs to reflect the realities of exploding demand and of the laws of physics that dictate how electricity is generated, transmitted, and delivered. We believe we are well positioned to be part of the long-term solution supplying reliable, affordable baseload energy for consumers and creating long-term value for our unitholders. Now, turning to strategic updates related to our business. In 2024, we expect to complete the major infrastructure projects at Tunnel Ridge, Hamilton, Warrior, and the River View complex.
As Cary mentioned, ARLP will start to recognize the benefits from these strategic investments in 2025 as capital expenditures will be significantly lower and our mines will be more productive, ensuring we maintain our position as the most reliable low-cost producer in the United States -- in the eastern United States over the next decade. Turning to our royalties segment. We remain committed to growing our oil and gas royalties business, which delivered record volumes in 2023. Over the past year, we acquired $111 million in additional oil and gas minerals, primarily concentrated in the Permian Basin.
This marks our largest investment year since 2019. We love the cash flow potential the segment offers via hedge-free exposure to commodity price and organic growth. As we look to 2024, I would comment that during periods of commodity price volatility, the size and timing of acquisitions can be difficult to predict as our growth strategy relies on strict underwriting standards for investment that we will not compromise in tight markets. We also remain committed to pursuing growth opportunities beyond coal and oil and gas royalties.
As we advance these initiatives, our investment decisions will be selective, aligned with our core competencies, and focused on areas where we can add significant strategic value. Let me be clear, we are not interested in building a portfolio of passive venture capital-style investments. Initial positions should be thought of as potential platforms for future lines of business with long-term growth and cash flow generation. To that end, two weeks ago, we announced that our wholly owned subsidiary, Matrix Design Group, entered into an agreement with Infinitum to develop and distribute high-efficiency, reliable motors and advanced motor controllers designed specifically for the mining industry.
This collaboration represents a natural progression and extension of our initial investment in Infinitum back in 2022. We believe their groundbreaking motor technology will bring much-needed innovation to the mining industry by delivering more efficient and higher-performing production equipment. Specific to Alliance, we believe their technology will improve our mining processes, reduce capital and operating costs, and help extend the life of certain mining equipment. Additionally, while we are unable to publicly quantify any potential revenue impacts at this time, we believe the relationship could lead to new revenue streams for Matrix by selling additional products to third-party mining customers and OEMs around the world like Matrix is currently doing as a technology leader for underground proximity detection systems.
In closing, our business continues to be a generator of strong cash flows that positions us to continue improving our balance sheet by simultaneously pursuing the highest and best uses for our capital. I am proud of our ARLP's performance in 2023 and encouraged by the opportunities in front of us as we gear up for what should be another successful year in 2024. That concludes our prepared comments, and I'll now ask the operator to open the call for questions.
Questions & Answers:

Operator
Thank you.
Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Operator.
Operator
Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Thank you. And our first question will be coming from the line of Nathan Martin with The Benchmark Company.
Please proceed with your questions.
Nate Martin -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst
Yeah. Thanks, operator. Good morning, Joe. Good morning, Cary.
Thanks for taking my questions.
Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
Nate Martin -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst
I wanted to start with the distribution this quarter. Coverage ratio is 1.8 times, looks like, for the full year '23, but it did dip to 1.3 times in the fourth quarter. And I know you guys have said you're OK with the distribution dipping down temporarily, but it seems like keeping it closer to two times, this is where you prefer to be, obviously. But it'd be great to get your thoughts there on the distribution and the coverage.
And I think you mentioned last quarter that your board meeting will be behind you by the time this call came around. So, maybe any takeaways from those conversations as well. Thank you.
Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, thank you for the question. So, we did finish the year, as you mentioned, with those coverage ratios that are included in our press release. As we look to 2024, as we've indicated, you know, we believe '24 has the potential to be just as good as 2023. You know, there are opportunities as we go looking toward '25.
We're also optimistic about our opportunities in '25. You know, we just talked about, you know, the capital will be coming down substantially in '25 versus '24. We believe our operating costs will be lower and primarily because of the efficiency projects we've talked about. We believe natural gas should be higher priced in 2025 because of the LNG terminals that are coming online in the back half of 2024 in the United States.
So, there's a lot to be optimistic about. We've signed some long-term contracts that give us some stability through 2028. Yet, at the same time, we do have not as much contracted in '25 as we have in '24, where we got over 90%. So, I think as we move through the year, you know, the board will make a decision on a quarter-by-quarter basis as to whether to maintain the distribution at the $0.70 level.
I believe we're in a position to do so, and that would be my expectation. And the other factor that we'll have to consider is how does the market react to our continued growth and our continued opportunities that we have in front of us. You know, as I've mentioned in the past, we've been disappointed that our unit price didn't track the distribution increase that we gave in 2023. So, it'll be a quarter-by-quarter decision, but we're -- as Cary mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're very focused on growing our company, maintaining and growing our cash flow, and returning that to the shareholders, similar to what we've been doing over the last 25 years.
Nate Martin -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst
I appreciate that color there, Joe. Maybe next, just a bit of a multipronged question. You know, you just mentioned some of the contracts you guys did. It looks like an additional 12 million tons over that 2024 to 2028 period.
First, is it possible to get a breakdown of how those tons were spread throughout that time period, and then maybe, you know, some more color on what the pricing look like? And then second, for this year specifically in '24, you know, what portion of those committed tons are fixed price and what portion are open to market pricing still at this point? I would assume the domestic tons are largely fixed, but are your export tons tied to an index, you know, like API2 or something, where you could have some volatility? Are there any floors or ceilings in those contracts maybe like some of your peers have had?
Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
So, as far as the actual volume beyond 2024, I'm not -- I don't have those numbers right now. I don't know if you've got those, Cary. But back to the pricing, the pricing in '24 of our contract book is comparable to what our 2023 average revenues are. Domestic contracts do have escalators in them.
Some are fixed. Some are actually indices. They're -- you know, our export volumes, I believe, this just goes through 2024. I don't think we have any in the out years, and those are fixed prices.
Some of them do have index -- they do tie to indices. Specifically, our metallurgical contracts are tied to some indices that will fluctuate based on what the market is. What did I miss from your questions?
Cary Marshall -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I think, Nate, just in a follow-up in terms of the out years, I think if you go back and look at where we were guiding last quarter, you know, just in terms of commitments, if you look in the out years of those 12 million tons, they do go, you know, as we mentioned, out to 2028. Most of those volumes that go out for that period of time are in the 1.5 million ton range once you get beyond the 2024 period. So, if you look at 2025 to 2028, you know, that would give you an indication of the level of contracts.
Some of them will scale up and scale down. But, you know, they may be 2 million one year and then kind of scale down to, you know, closer to 1.25 million as you get toward the tail end of it. But generally speaking, it's, you know, fairly significant volume, you know, as you go over that 2025 through 2028 time period.
Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
And the message is, you know, they understand that they need to start layering in some volume, and they're basically giving us confidence that those plants are needed, not only through the '28 time period, but beyond. So, you know, we are hearing from our customers that the expectations are that with grid reliability, with the growth in electrification, that the existing fleet of coal plants need to stay open longer. And, you know, we will see that play out. I mean, you know, the Biden administration, you know, continues to suggest that they don't need to keep the plants open, whereas Republican candidates have all suggested that we do.
So, you know, I think that we believe that the law of physics is going to require and the growth in demand that these plants will stay open and that our -- you know, we're very confident that our production volumes will be sustained for the next five to six to seven years.
Nate Martin -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst
That's very helpful, guys. Maybe just to kind of wrap that up, I mean, really, I guess my questions kind of revolve around maybe what gets you to the low or the high end of your full year '24 price per ton guidance. And you've got 32.5 million tons, it looks like, committed and priced. Maybe what's the assumption there and API2 price if that's what your export volumes are tied to? And we've seen some pressure there, obviously.
You mentioned that domestic contracts where you're pricing those have been above the spot rates. So, that's a positive. Just trying to get a sense of maybe what gets you to the low or high end of that range. Thank you.
Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, the whole range is going to be dependent on the export market. So, we've seen the export pricing on the indexes drop probably $10 or $12 in the last month. We don't believe that's sustainable. We believe that the pricing will get back in the API2 level that's greater than $110 to $120 range because we believe that that's what the world supply will demand for that -- you know, for those products.
We do believe that demand is stable. However, the pricing right now is a little soft. And so, the whole swinging will be how we place those export tons throughout 2024. That will be the determining factor as to the ranges that you spoke to.
But when you look at the total compared to our UI position, it doesn't move the needle that much because we have so little tons that are needed to be placed, you know, for 2024.
Nate Martin -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst

Our next question is from the line of Mark Reichman with Noble Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.
Mark Reichman -- Noble Capital Markets -- Analyst
Thank you and good morning.
Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
Mark Reichman -- Noble Capital Markets -- Analyst
So, going into the fourth quarter, you know, the delta between what was committed and priced in 2023 and the -- your guidance, that was kind of expected to be kind of what happened in the export market. So, the tons sold came in kind of at the low end compared to, you know, the guidance. So, when do you expect that delta between committed and priced and what was sold, you know, to carry over into 2024? Will that mainly be in the first quarter or -- and I assume that's kind of already kind of baked into the 2024 guidance.
Cary Marshall -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yes, that's right. That's right, Mark. We would expect those tonnages to roll over into the first quarter, and it is baked into the guidance that we provided.
Mark Reichman -- Noble Capital Markets -- Analyst
OK. And then, you know, during the last conference call, you didn't expect much in the way of fourth quarter outside coal purchases, but sequentially, the number increased over 20 million from 11.5 million. So, did the adverse conditions at Mettiki, did those just extend beyond your expectations, and do you think we're done with the outside coal purchases?
Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
So, yeah. So, we -- in the last earnings call, we felt like the longwall would be up and running by the end of November, and it was actually delayed until the end of December. So, we did have some shipments that we needed to buy, some coal that we thought we would be able to produce that we came up a little short. And we may have to actually buy some in the first quarter.
The longwall did come up the last week of December. It is operating as expected. But depending on whether the timing of shipments is possible, we may have some purchases in the first quarter. I don't believe we are anticipating anything beyond that.
Mark Reichman -- Noble Capital Markets -- Analyst
OK. That was -- at least when I compared it to what our estimates look like, I think we were at the low end, but that was kind of a difference. And then just lastly, you know, I know it's too early to talk about revenues, but this agreement between Infinitum and Matrix, rather than, you know, revenue numbers, can you just kind of maybe highlight the economics of becoming a global distributor for Infinitum and are there any shared arrangements on the development of new mining products? So, I mean, will they just get the margin, you know, from the sale of Infinitum's items, projects, products or are there some other like, you know, when they go in and install, you know, a project for a mining customer, are there other sources of revenue? What is kind of the revenue substack or revenue stack look like for Matrix when they enter an arrangement like that with Infinitum?
Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Well, the initial project that we're working on, you know, they basically are making equipment that, effectively, we're going to be testing in our operations in 2024. That'll start, I believe, in the second quarter of this year. Cary, do you have those more specifics? And then that will roll in, and then we will start to hoping -- hopefully be marketing those in 2025.
Cary Marshall -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, that's right. That's right, Joe. You know, our -- the products, you know, kind of goes back to -- similar to what we did with IntelliZone where we're providing proof of concept for these underground. And so, we have been in discussions with the regulatory agencies here, you know, for underground mining and do anticipate those going underground here.
Certainly, by the second quarter, you know, we're hoping to push it, you know, even a little bit quicker than that.
Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
And we've got another motor technology that we're also working on that would also need MSHA approval. And that's to -- we would think that that would be manufactured and then sold into 2025. You know, our initial focus will be domestically, but then it, too, would be rolling out similar to our proximity device in IntelliZone that is currently being marketed in South Africa and Australia.
Mark Reichman -- Noble Capital Markets -- Analyst
OK. Well, that's very helpful [Inaudible]
Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
So, I think that when we look at -- to try to give you some idea. So, I think we've got invested around $67 million in Infinitum, and we believe that the cash flow that we'll receive just from these two announcements are going to give us an attractive double-digit return just on that investment as a byproduct of that relationship. And that doesn't even anticipate what we would get on that actual investment in Infinitum. So, that sort of gives you an idea of the scale of the opportunity just from this one or these two products that we are talking -- or ready to design, build, and sell into the marketplace.
Mark Reichman -- Noble Capital Markets -- Analyst
Well, that's really helpful, and I appreciate that. I really didn't have too many questions on the guidance. I thought that was pretty straightforward and looked pretty good. So, thank you very much.
Cary Marshall -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer

Our next question is from the line of David Marsh with Singular Research. Please proceed with your questions.
David Marsh -- Singular Research -- Analys
Hi, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Appreciate it. And congrats on a really great year.
Just as we start to look forward into '24, you know, I guess some of my questions kind of echo a little bit some of the questions previously. I mean, particularly, in Appalachia, it looks like, you know, you guys had some margin compression. Was that in part or largely due to your production shortfall there and in your need to purchase, you know, other externally produced coal?
Cary Marshall -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean, that's right, David. I mean that there was margin compression in Appalachia, you know, and primarily driven by the items that we talked about with the production issues, particularly in the back half of the year, that we experienced within the region.
Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
So, essentially, we had -- a longwall at Mettiki didn't operate the second half of the year. So, you know, that now is operating, so you're going to see us go -- you know, that volume to come back into the market. At MC, we went from four units to three units starting, I believe, in September or October. So, we're planning to operate at three units at MC.
Yeah, we do have some new equipment there, so we think that our costs should be relatively stable. Yeah.
Cary Marshall -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
And then --
Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
In '24 there. But --
Cary Marshall -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
And then, David, as you look into 2024 in terms of the compression that you see on the margins on that side of it, that's primarily on the top-line-driven as we had some higher-priced contracts that were -- that we shipped on in 2023 that expired, and the market environment's a little bit lower as we look at where we're contracted in 2024 related to the Appalachia region.
David Marsh -- Singular Research -- Analys
Right. Understood. So, just pulling that thread forward on the Appalachian EBITDA expense per ton, we should naturally expect that to decline from the fourth quarter level, correct? And then what would the trajectory be of that? I mean, do you think you can get back down into the 40s, or is that -- are we, you know, living in a 50s kind of world in terms of expense per ton there?
Cary Marshall -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Go ahead.
Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
I'd say you're looking at the 50s, not the 40s. The industry is -- you know, experienced inflation, like all others. But -- so all of our costs have gone up somewhat just because of inflation. But then you factor in going from four units to three.
Another factor in Appalachia in 2024 is, you know, we're in the process of moving to the new reserves we bought at Tunnel Ridge. And so, we do have shorter panels in 2024 compared to historic, as well as projected in '25 forward. So, we're probably going to have some reduction in volume at Tunnel Ridge that enters into that mix. But yeah, you're looking at, you know, probably mid-50s in Appalachia for the year would be the estimate right now, somewhere in that, which is what we've sort of guided to, the $54.25 to $57.25.
David Marsh -- Singular Research -- Analys
Yeah. And I mean, are we going to -- I'm just trying to get an understanding of trajectory on it. Will it start still kind of closer to the Q4 level and gradually decline throughout the year or is it going to just -- you know, is there going to be a pop down and then a flat kind of throughout the year?
Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Right now, our quarter -- our first quarter appears to -- it looks like it'll be in the low end of the range, if not lower than the range. So, if we can get the volume out of Mettiki that we're anticipating, the first quarter should be a good quarter. And then when you look at the trajectory beyond 2024 into '25, we should start seeing the benefits of us getting into the new reserves at Tunnel Ridge. So, we should see some decline in the 2025 time period, depending on inflation, of course.
David Marsh -- Singular Research -- Analys
Got it.
Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
I mean, inflation could take some of that away.
David Marsh -- Singular Research -- Analys
Yeah. Sure. Absolutely. Well, that's excellent.
That's very, very helpful. And then just lastly for me, you know, in terms of -- you know, as you look at your cash flow and your opportunity set with that cash flow, could you just kind of rank it in terms of priorities, you know, expansion capex into like the new lines of business that you've been pursuing versus debt reduction and a potential increase to the distribution?
Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
So, I think our priority, as Cary mentioned, will be pay down the debt. We will be paying down the senior notes in '24 and potentially in the first quarter of next year. However, he's also looking at financing -- or refinancing or entering into some facilities that will give us capacity to grow. You know, some of them will be funded.
But most -- you know, hopefully, some of them will be unfunded and be revolver-type arrangements. So then, you know, as far as growth, we've talked about oil and gas. You know, we'll continue to invest there. We will still have opportunities to invest in other items.
You know, there's nothing on the horizon that I can give you any specifics on how we would allocate that capital, but we are continuing to look at multiple areas of investment. And so, we've got a capital allocation process that will evaluate investments in future cash flow growth, which we do put as a priority. And then alternatively, we will look at, you know, whether there are other uses for that capital. I mean, I think that distributions continue to be high on our priority list.
So, it's my goal that, you know, distributions will be consistent. But we got to evaluate, you know, the future as -- you know, on a quarter-by-quarter basis, as we talked about. So, that will include not only just, you know, the future markets, but just as important, the opportunities in front of us to make investments.
David Marsh -- Singular Research -- Analys
Got it. Thank you very much. That's all I have.

Our next question is from the line of Dave Storms with Stonegate Capital. Please proceed with your questions.
Dave Storms -- Stonegate Capital Partners -- Analyst
Good morning.
Cary Marshall -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Hello. Good morning.
Dave Storms -- Stonegate Capital Partners -- Analyst
Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones for me. Curious as to how you're thinking about the labor outlook now that we're kind of through the holidays and, you know, maybe labor might start picking up. I know you mentioned that you might be sticking with the three units at Mettiki, I believe it was.
But, you know, as some of these capital improvement projects is expected to be completed this year, is that going to require, you know, increased hiring?
Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
So, we have seen an improvement in our retention and our availability of labor, specifically in Illinois Basin as an example. So, we do have the Henderson County mine that we are developing that should become operational -- well, it is operational as we're ramping, but it should get to where we will be increasing staffing at that mine by the end of 2024 or during 2024. As that ramps up, we expect that that plant -- or that mine will be -- you know, will have more production starting in '25. Effectively, what we're doing at River View is we're basically having two portals instead of one, and that second portal will be at Henderson County.
So, there will be some hiring there. There's still -- there's a need of some hiring at our mines, just back to normal attrition, not what we've been experiencing in the last two or three years, but what we would consider to be normal. So, I think on a labor front, we're in a better position than we have been historically. At MC Mining, you know, we still see challenges, so we're currently not anticipating increasing that mine back to four units.
It's possible, but that's the one area that we're continuing to see challenges of being able to attract sufficient numbers to commit to bringing back that unit. But I think everywhere else, and we've been encouraged by the recent activity, people wanting to come work for us.
Dave Storms -- Stonegate Capital Partners -- Analyst
Very helpful. Thank you. And then just on the inventory front, how comfortable are you with your current inventory levels? Are you expecting to continue to burn those off? I know they were impacted by that temporary outage. Now that hopefully things are starting to normalize, would you expect your inventory levels to continue to track down slightly?
Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
I think, you know, our goal is to maintain, you know, more than likely, just as a working inventory level, given the amount of tons we're putting in the export market. It's right at a million tons a month. But it will fluctuate based on timing of vessels because, you know, the vessels, you know, take -- you know, it may be on the 30th, it may be on the 2nd, and so there could be 60,000 to 100,000 tons right there that could put us in a position that we could be a little higher than that. But our goal would be to maintain inventory right at that million-ton-a-month level.
Right now, I think it's around 1.3 million, something of that nature. But -- so it's going to be in that swing area, I would say.
Dave Storms -- Stonegate Capital Partners -- Analyst
Understood. And then last one for me, kind of on a macro level. I thought I saw that LNG export terminal constructions have been paused in the U.S. Do you anticipate that if this becomes a prolonged pause that it will increase demand for international coal as, you know, consumers need to switch from LNG to coal, or is this not something we should really have on our radar at this point?
Joe Craft -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
The pause is not in construction, it's on new permits. It may be permits would be under -- currently under regulatory review. But as far as the terminals that are under construction, they're continuing to be completed. And the permits that have been issued but are not under construction, it's our understanding heading that those, too, are allowed to proceed.
So, we don't anticipate any interruption in the demand and/or supply for LNG, you know, until the end of the decade, you know, as a result of these permits. So, we believe that these permits -- these plants that have been permitted will, in fact, be developed and that the demand for LNG will continue to be strong for, you know, the remaining decade.
Dave Storms -- Stonegate Capital Partners -- Analyst
That's very helpful. Thank you.

Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. 2023 was a great year for Halliburton. Both of our divisions achieved their highest operating margins in over a decade, and we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders. Here are the highlights.
We delivered full year total company revenue of $23 billion, an increase of 13% year over year; and operating income of $4.1 billion, an increase of 33% compared to 2022 adjusted operating income. Our international business demonstrated strong growth with our revenue up 17% year over year despite our exit from Russia in August of 2022, completing two consecutive years of high teens growth. Our North America business showed strength with revenue up 9% year over year despite rig count declines. Completion and production revenue grew 18% year over year, and margins expanded 312 basis points.
Drilling and evaluation grew 7% year over year, and margins expanded 171 basis points. Turning now to Q4, where Halliburton delivered exceptional margin performance, supported by better-than-anticipated completion tool sales globally, strong performance across multiple high-margin product lines, and favorable weather in North America. Completion and production margins finished the year almost 100 basis points higher than Q4 of 2022. International revenue grew 12% year over year, led by the Europe/Africa region, which grew revenue 17%.
Finally, during the fourth quarter, we generated $1.4 billion of cash from operations, $1.1 billion of free cash flow, and repurchased approximately $250 million of common stock and $150 million of debt. Before we continue, I want to take a moment and thank the Halliburton employees around the world who made these results possible. Our success last quarter and throughout 2023 was a direct result of your hard work and dedication. Thank you for your relentless focus on safety, operational execution, customer collaboration, and service quality performance.
Let me begin with my views on the strength of the oilfield services market. As we look past the new cycle and near-term commodity price volatility, the fundamentals for oilfield services remain strong. Here are two reasons why. First, we see an increase in service intensity everywhere we operate.
Whether it's longer laterals in North America, smaller and more complex reservoirs in mature fields, or offshore deepwater, customers require more services to develop their resources, not fewer. Second, long-term expansion of the global economy will continue to create enormous demands on all forms of energy. I expect oil and gas remains a critical component of the global energy mix with demand growth well into the future. With this positive macro outlook, I believe Halliburton's strong execution, leading technology, and collaborative approach will drive demand for Halliburton's products and services around the world.
Now, let's turn to international markets, where Halliburton's performance delivered another year of profitable growth. Halliburton's full year international revenue grew 17% year on year, and our quarterly revenue grew 12% compared to the same quarter of last year. Each region delivered year-on-year revenue growth throughout 2023, and both divisions delivered improved international margins year on year. Our results in 2023 demonstrate the effectiveness of Halliburton's profitable international growth strategy, the strength of our global competitiveness across product lines, and the power of our value proposition with customers.
In 2024, we expect international E&P spending to grow at a low double-digit pace and foresee multiple years of sustained activity growth. Although we anticipate regional differences in growth rates for 2024, we believe the Middle East/Asia region will likely experience the greatest increases in activity with other regions closely behind. As we look out to 2025, we expect Africa and Europe, among others, to demonstrate above-average growth. Beyond 2025, we see an active tender pipeline with work scopes extending through the end of the decade, which gives me confidence in the duration of this multiyear upcycle.
While we expect overall activity growth, we also see above-market growth within our well construction product lines, where customers choose Halliburton to improve the reliability, consistency, and efficiency of their drilling operations. One such technology is LOGIX's autonomous drilling platform, which is now used on 90% of our iCruise runs worldwide. Customers also rely on Halliburton's subsurface expertise to develop today's most complex reservoirs. This requires technologies to reduce uncertainties, such as our DecisionSpace 365, unified ensemble modeling, and advanced formation evaluation systems like our iStar logging well drilling platform, and reservoir Xaminer formation testing service.
These technologies enable customers to target small reservoirs, identify bypassed reserves and gather reservoir properties in real time. We see reservoir complexity increasing worldwide, and I expect the capabilities of these systems will continue to deliver customer value and lead in overall growth within our formation evaluation portfolio. For completion and production, we also expect increased adoption of our technologies like intelligent completions, multilateral solutions, and artificial lift. Our intelligent and multilateral completions enable customers to produce, inject, and control multiple zones in a wellbore, which is critical for offshore developments, a segment we expect to outpace the overall market.
In artificial lift, our strategy targets markets like the Middle East and Latin America, where our differentiated performance and existing footprint create a solid foundation for profitable growth. We also expect strong demand for our services in carbon capture and storage, where Halliburton's leading capabilities to design, deliver, and validate reliable barriers play a crucial role. As our customers invest in carbon storage, our tailored cement designs and casing equipment technology enable them to address the unique challenges of long-term carbon sequestration. With this activity growth, the availability of equipment and experienced personnel remains tight.
We expect asset-intensive offshore activity to increase, which will further tighten the market. As offshore represents over half of our business outside North America land, we expect this activity to drive improved pricing and higher margins for our business. I am confident in Halliburton's strategy for profitable international growth, and I am excited about our performance in 2024 and well into the future. Turning to North America.
Halliburton's strategy yielded strong results in 2023. Our full year North America revenue of $10.5 billion was a 9% increase when compared to 2022 despite sequentially lower rig count. Fourth quarter margins in North America land were relatively flat quarter over quarter despite lower revenue. Our full year and fourth quarter results demonstrated the strength of our differentiated business and the successful execution of our strategy to maximize value.
The dynamic North America market continues to evolve with larger customers and stable programs, elevated quality expectations and greater demand for technology to improve recovery and well productivity. This evolution fits perfectly with Halliburton's value proposition. Our Zeus electric fracturing solution is highly sought after in this market, where its seamless combination of electric frac, automation and real-time subsurface measurements uniquely address customer requirements. We believe customers demand Zeus because it provides the lowest total cost of ownership and it's shown to be the most proven and reliable solution in the market.
The market pull for this technology has been strong. The combination of Zeus fleets working in the field today and Zeus fleets contracted for 2024 delivery represent over 40% of our fracturing fleet. I expect well over half of our fleets will be electric in 2025 with all of these e-fleets on multiyear contracts generating full return of and return on capital during their initial contract terms. Consistent with our strategy from the beginning, we plan for our Zeus deliveries in 2024 to replace existing fleets rather than add incremental fleet capacity.
This is how we maximize value in North America. The growth of Zeus and our commercial approach has transformed the North America completion services market. Technology is only transformative when adopted and is only adopted at the rate of Zeus when it works and creates meaningful value for our customers. Zeus' rapid adoption, both by new and repeat customers, tells us our solution is the right one for North America.
Turning to our 2024 North America outlook. We expect a continued strong business with the combination of stable levels of activity in the market and the contracted nature of Halliburton's portfolio. We expect this results in a flattish revenue and margin environment for Halliburton. To close out, I am confident in our strategies to maximize value in North America and for profitable growth internationally.
In 2023, Halliburton demonstrated the power of these strategies, the consistency of our execution and the value of our differentiated technology. We generated about $2.3 billion of free cash flow during the year, retired approximately $300 million of debt and returned $1.4 billion of cash to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends, which represents over 60% of our free cash flow. Today, I am pleased to announce that our bard of directors approved an increase of our quarterly dividend to $0.17 per share. Our outlook for oilfield services remains strong, and I expect we will deepen and strengthen our value proposition and generate significant free cash flow.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric?
Eric Carre -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. 2023 was a strong year for Halliburton. Multiple financial and operational metrics showed the best business performance in recent memory, any one of which are worthy of highlighting. More important than any single metric, however, the overall business performance demonstrated the effectiveness of our strategy.
Here are a few highlights. In our C&P division, our 2023 margins of 20.7% were the highest since 2011. In our D&E division, 2023 margins of 16.5% were the highest since 2008. In North America, our strategy to maximize value is about structurally changing the risk and return profile of our business.
We delivered steady margins through the year despite lower activity, driven by the rollout of our Zeus fleet and their associated contract terms and the strength of our well construction business. Internationally, our profitable growth strategy drove revenue and margin improvement across all of our geographies. Revenue was the highest in the last 8 years, and profit margins were the highest in over a decade. Beyond pricing and activity, this is the result of the multiyear investment in our drilling business and technology differentiation across multiple product lines.
Our focus on capital efficiency allowed this revenue growth and structural margin improvement, while capital spending remained within our target range of 5% to 6% of revenue. Collectively, these results generated about $2.3 billion of free cash flow, the highest cash generation in the last 15 years. Let's turn now to our fourth quarter results. Our Q4 reported net income per diluted share was $0.74.
Net income per diluted share, adjusted for losses in Argentina primarily due to the currency devaluation, was $0.86. Total company revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $5.7 billion. Operating income was $1.1 billion, and the operating margin was 18.4%, a 95 basis point increase over Q4 2022. Beginning with our completion and production division, revenue in Q4 was $3.3 billion, operating income was $716 million, and the operating income margin was 22%.
Our better-than-anticipated results were driven by the best fourth quarter of completion tool sales in nine years, strong performance across multiple product lines, and favorable weather in North America. In our drilling and evaluation division, revenue in Q4 was $2.4 billion, operating income was $420 million, and the operating income margin was 17%, an increase of 122 basis point over Q4 last year. These results were in line with our expectation and driven by international software sales, higher project management activity in the Eastern Hemisphere, and increased fluid services in the Western Hemisphere. Now, let's move on to geographic results.
Our Q4 international revenue increased 4% sequentially, which was our highest international revenue quarter since 2015 and 10th consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue growth. Q4 sequential growth was led by the Middle East region driven by improved activity across multiple product lines and strong year-end completion tool sales. Europe/Africa demonstrated sequential growth consistent with the overall international market with higher activity in Africa offsetting lower product sales in Europe. Latin America revenue declined slightly in the fourth quarter, where reduced completion-related activity following a very strong third quarter activity improvements in the Caribbean.
In North America, revenue in Q4 decreased 7% sequentially driven primarily by a decline in U.S. land activity as a result of typical holiday-related slowdowns. However, we experienced fewer weather-related events than expected. As weather-related downtime is more expensive than planned downtime, this means our Q4 North America land margins were higher than anticipated.
Additionally, completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico delivered the strongest quarter in three years. Moving on to other items. In Q4, our corporate and other expense was $63 million. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect corporate expenses to be flat.
Our SAP deployment remains on budget and on schedule to conclude in 2025. In Q4, we spent $15 million or about $0.02 per diluted share on SAP S4 migration, which is included in our results. For the first quarter 2024, we expect these expenses to be approximately $30 million or $0.03 per share due to the timing associated with accelerated phases of the rollout. In 2024, we expect to spend $120 million and $80 million in 2025.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $98 million, slightly higher than expected primarily due to premiums associated with debt buybacks. For the first quarter 2024, we expect net interest expense to be roughly $85 million. Other net expense for Q4 was $16 million lower than our prior guidance due to the non-GAAP treatment of the Argentinian peso devaluation. For the first quarter 2024, we expect this expense to be about $35 million.
Our adjusted effective tax rate for Q4 was 17.9%, lower than expected due to discrete items. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our first quarter 2024 effective tax rate to be approximately 21%, slightly lower than our anticipated full year effective tax rate. Capital expenditure for Q4 were $399 million, which brought our full year capex total to $1.4 billion. Approximately 60% of our capex was deployed to international and offshore markets in 2023, and we expect this ratio to remain similar in 2024.
For the full year of 2024, we expect capital expenditures to remain approximately 6% of revenue. Our Q4 cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion and free cash flow was $1.1 billion, bringing our full year free cash flow to about $2.3 billion. For 2024, we expect free cash flow to be directionally higher. Now, let me provide you with some comments on our expectations for the first quarter.
As is typical, our results will be subject to weather-related seasonality and the roll-off of significant year-end product sales. As a result, in our completion and production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be flat to down 2% and margins lower by 125 to 175 basis points. In our drilling and evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to decline between 1% to 3% and margins to be lower by 25 to 75 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff.
Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. 2023 was a great year for Halliburton. We generated about $2.3 billion of free cash flow and returned over 60% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.
We're committed to return over 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2024. For our international business, we expect low double-digit growth driven by the power of our value proposition, global competitiveness across all product lines and our profitable growth strategy. In North America, we expect a continued strong business driven by stable activity, our differentiated technical position with our Zeus electric frac solution and the increasingly contracted nature of our business. And now let's open it up for questions.
Questions & Answers:

Operator
[Operator instructions] First question comes from Dave Anderson with Barclays. You may proceed.
Dave Anderson -- Barclays -- Analyst
Thanks. Good morning, Jeff. How are you?
Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, David.
Dave Anderson -- Barclays -- Analyst
So, a question on the C&P margins that held flat during the quarter, and you said U.S. land was holding flat. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the influence of your growing e-frac fleet on the bottom line. We know the operational advantages, but I was wondering if you could talk about how it impacts financially.
How does e-frac, say -- compared to, say, your Tier 4 dual fuel, the diesel fleets just in terms of pricing and operating costs, trying to get a sense of how accretive the new equipment is. And sort of secondarily on that, with E&P consolidation well underway and we look out, say, 12 to 24 months, would you expect the majority of your e-frac fleets to be with these larger operators under multiyear contracts?
Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Well, thanks, Dave. Look, e-fleets are accretive. They're accretive for a couple of reasons.
Number one, highly efficient to operate from our standpoint. And so, that makes them more accretive. Clearly, the are bringing a lot of value to clients, and therefore, they're, you know, priced and thought about differently in the marketplace. And so, look, I expect that, that will continue into the future.
But I think what's most important is the contracted nature of the fleets, which mean a couple of things also. Number one, that the pricing is sticky, but it's sticky because it's contracted over time and the value is thought about. And so, sophisticated procurers can look at that and model that, and we can model it as well and comfortable with the value created. But I think the second thing, as we think about what types of customers look at e-fleets, these aren't a spot market solution.
I mean the companies that are interested in e-fleets are those that have steady programs, work through cycles, have a clear vision of where their business needs to go and are willing to commit to the technology to deliver that over the long term. And so -- and really, it's an entire system. If we think about an electric fleet, it's -- obviously, it's an efficient, lowest TCO electric solution, but it's also automated, which drives the level of precision around fracking that, you know, I've never seen before. And so, you know, the clients know that they're delivering what they expect to deliver.
And then, finally, the subsurface measurement. But I bring all of that up because that's part of what drives it being accretive. A, it creates a lot more value, therefore, is more accretive than a Tier 4 diesel fleet clearly, and then also a different set of conditions, which also changes the return profile of these assets as we go into the market. I hope that helps, Dave.
Dave Anderson -- Barclays -- Analyst
It does. A clear differentiation there. So, a separate question here. I noticed in your release, you announced two new collaborations with other service companies, one in reservoir analysis, the other MPD.
It sort of effectively fills a few of your weaker spots of your portfolio. And if I just think back to last cycle, we saw a number of acquisitions, but I don't recall too many collaborations out there. I mean, on the one hand -- I guess, from my point of view, on the one hand, maybe you're testing the waters a bit, but on the other, it seems like it's a pretty good way to fill product lines without spending a lot of capital. I was wondering if you could talk about the strategy and why it's different during the current cycle.
And would you expect to enter more collaborations in the coming years?
Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Well, look, I think it's more a function of the technology that we have and when we see -- you know, we've developed some things around, you know, digital cores and the ability to evaluate them digitally, for example, but trying to buy our way into the entire core space. We'd rather partner with who we think the premier core analysis company is. And so we're able to bring our technology to that. And effectively, it's a complementary strategy where we make better returns doing the things that we've developed and know how to do.
And obviously, we believe Core Lab is a fantastic company. And so, we're able to bring something to that that we believe creates more value rather than trying to enter into a different type of arrangement. You mentioned the other one was Oil States. Similar kind of thing, they got terrific technology, but we don't know that we want to try to plow that much capital into the rest of their business.
But we do know where we can generate outsized returns for Halliburton. Yeah, I would throw in another similar type thing is subsea with TechnipFMC, who -- I really believe TechnipFMC is the absolute premier subsea company in the world. And we work closely with them, developing joint IP, delivering on electric completions, all electric completions. And so there are a lot of things we're able to do where we can mine what I think is our core competency or competitive advantage along with others without trying to broaden our way into things that aren't really strategically fit.
Hope that helps, Dave.
Dave Anderson -- Barclays -- Analyst
Very helpful. Thank you very much, Jeff.
Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Certainly.
Operator
Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.
Neil Mehta -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Good morning, Jeff and team. Appreciate the time. The first question is around a more macro question, which is one of the things that surprised us last year was the exit to exit of U.S. oil production, which came in above, I think, where consensus expectations were.
You have unique visibility into U.S. completion and volumes. What do you think happened there? And as we think about 2024, how do you think about exit rate of U.S. growth? And maybe talk about the moving pieces, including DUCs.
Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Look, if I'm thinking about production growth in '24, you know, production is a function of service intensity. So, simply put, more sand, more barrels. And we saw peak levels of service intensity throughout last -- really in the first half of last year.
And a lot of that comes on in the latter half. And I think some of this is efficiency in the sense that we are delivering more sand to the reservoir. And that comes in a lot of forms. E-fleets are part of that and some of the technology that we brought to market.
But I also think that the market that we see for next year, it's hard for me to forecast at this point exactly what operators will do because every operator plays their own game. But at the same time, you know, I would probably be over on rigs because I think that we'll run out of DUCs at some point. I think I would take the under only production only because whatever you think it is, I'll take the under only because what we see are stable customers delivering to their plans. But what we don't see as a lot of the smaller companies coming into the market in an effort to really ramp up production.
So, I think, you know, from our perspective at Halliburton, very stable market. But from a production standpoint, as we watch it unfold, it will be a matter of how much incremental sand gets pumped to overcome what is clearly going to be a decline rate that comes with when we add barrels rapidly, obviously, they fall off rapidly.
Neil Mehta -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Thanks, Jeff. Good color there. And then you made a comment that you feel like you have international visibility through the end of the decade. Can you expand there and help give the market a little more confidence about what the post-2024, 2025 profile looks like?
Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Well, look, I mean we are working on tenders today for work all of next year and the following year. I mean when we talk with customers, I think about what's going to happen. Really, I don't think the North Sea and West Africa even really wake up until 2025. We've seen strong in those markets.
However, the real growth we're working on planning today doesn't even start until '25. And all of these things are three- and four-year-type efforts. I mean these aren't individual wells in places like that. These are programs.
And so we spent -- we're actually on contract with a client working on just the planning of logistics for '25, '26, and beyond. And so I've just got a lot of confidence in terms of what we see in hand, the tender pipeline and then the pipeline of work that we are planning with customers that may or may not even be tendered. It's just more a matter of it will be done. And we've got clarity on that in '25 and beyond.
Neil Mehta -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Thanks, Jeff.
Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Yes, sir.
Operator
Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. You may proceed.
Arun Jayaram -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Yeah, good morning. Jeff, you mentioned that 40% of your contracted fleets this year will be Zeus going to 50% or more in '25. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how your commercial model for Zeus has evolved. And one of the things we get questions on is just the significant amount of completion efficiency gains that the industry is generated.
And what is the sharing of that between E&P and service company?
Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Well, look, I think, number one, it's the value created by Zeus is what drives the contracting nature. A couple of things. You know, when we started to develop Zeus, we started, like I said, quite a while back, our view was we want to maximize value to North America, number one. And in order to do that, we just had to -- we believe that the technology created enough value, so much value that we aren't going to build it unless it's demonstrated for customers.
And I think the contracting nature of the longer-term contracts, three-year-type contracts is because we let the market pull rather than trying to push thing into the market. It is that different and special. And as that system continues to develop and evolve, meaning automation, measurement, all of these things that drive really meaningful value, that is what's creating, I think, the different dialogue around Zeus with our customers because it will become more and more integral to how they create value as well. And then from an efficiency standpoint or like volume standpoint, our equipment is very efficient.
So, as we go from zipper frac to simo frac to, in this case, trial frac with the customer, you know, that is not a one-to-one increase in horsepower requirements. So, we become more efficient as those volumes go up. But that is also a unique feature, though, of Zeus and its ability to scale up, but it's not one for one. And so from Halliburton perspective, we do create outsized value for Halliburton and also for our clients because we're using less equipment than we would had we gone at it in a traditional fashion.
So, I think, you know, that the combination of reliability but also automation, because it's -- as those fracs -- as fracs get larger, the precision gets more important. There are a whole lot of things that start to happen. And so very collaborative efforts with our clients to utilize that technology. In the case of a trial frac, really groundbreaking type work, super excited to do it with this customer.
Arun Jayaram -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Great. Jeff, my follow-up, natural gas is on people's minds in North America. Just given the contango in the market, 2024 is just above 2 50. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how much of your activity is levered just to dry gas.
And what are some of the risks to the earnings picture from a soft market for gas this year?
Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Look, we've got very little gas exposure in our business. Today, the ones -- the exposure that we do have is contracted under -- is sort of the Zeus solution somewhat and then we've got, I guess, a little bit of other things. But look, the gas work that we have is not a significant part of our overall portfolio. And so, we plan for what we can see.
I think, you know, legitimately, there could be equal upside on gas as LNG comes on. But we haven't baked it into our outlook today. But I would say that's clearly one of the upsides to North America, maybe more so than a downside to North America.
Arun Jayaram -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Fair enough. Thanks, Jeff.
Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.
Roger Read -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Thank you. Good morning. And actually, I had the opportunity last week to visit a tribal frac site and saw the e-fleet. So, pretty impressive setup.
One of the things the customer mentioned was a slightly different, I guess, sort of price-to-value contract structure. Looks like from a margin standpoint, you're doing fine on that. But is there anything you can kind of enlighten us on, on maybe how we thought about traditional pressure pumping contracting and a lot of spot exposure versus, you know, kind of how this is going through? What does it mean in terms of sharing gains with the customer? What's the right way for us to think about that on kind of a price --
Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Look, from our standpoint, our -- Roger, thank you. We won't create value for our customers. I think you have to create meaningful value for customers in order to be a long-term supplier and partner to a customer. So, we start from that position.
And as you said, solid contract for us over the very long term. We went into this focused on maximize value, which in our view, means maximize returns, which we're able to do under these types of environments. And so, rather than play sort of the spot -- we don't intend to play the spot game. That spot game is kind of a -- it's a win-lose on either side of the market.
Really, when the market is getting tight, probably operators are losing. When it's going the other direction, service companies lose a lot. And our strategy is to stay out of that. And so, these right contracts with customers that, in our view, are fair and deliver a lot of value both in terms of pumping value and also recovery value.
And I think that we're uniquely positioned to do that. And so, improving recovery per foot or production per foot is a long-term game, and we want to play that long-term game with customers that are working on that long-term game. And we're ecstatic about the customers we have and who we get to work with, try to solve what we think are the real pressing issues of the future in North America frac. And so we don't get to play that game.
That game doesn't get played successfully if it's, you know, the frac is sure. We need to be part of that process, and our clients allow us to do that.
Roger Read -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Appreciate that. The follow-up question I have, it's unrelated, but I think kind of critical to the announcement this morning raising the dividend. What is the right way for us to think about your uses of free cash flow between, as you did in the fourth quarter, sort of elective repurchases of debt as opposed to, you know, maturities? But as we're thinking debt, dividend is pretty fixed here and then share repurchases. What way do you want us to think about the return of free cash flow?
Eric Carre -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Thanks, Roger. It's Eric. So, think about it in a fairly similar way as what we did in 2023, except higher.
So, we increased the dividend 6%. We're now back to about 95% of where we were pre-COVID. In terms of buyback, we intend to continue buying back share. Our intention today is to buy back more share in dollar terms in 2024 than we did in 2023.
At the same time, as we did also in 2023, we intend to continue to retire debt and continue to strengthen the balance sheet. So, overall, fairly similar structure in '24 as what we did in '23 but kind of bump up everything a bit higher.
Roger Read -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst

Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. You may proceed.
James West -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Hey, good morning, Jeff and Eric.
Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, James.
Eric Carre -- Chief Financial Officer
Good morning, James.
James West -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
So, Jeff, it -- you talked about West Africa, North Sea not awakening until '25. A lot of tendering or just conversations about '25, '26. I know some of the -- your partners like FTI are bidding for deliveries that wouldn't happen until '29 and '30. The offshore rig companies, they're getting locked up into '26, '27.
I mean the visibility this cycle seems to me to be somewhat unprecedented. And I'm curious if that's consistent with your view of how things are playing on how customers are behaving and how your conversations are going. Because it seems like the industry is on board with -- is it going to be a long cycle? What we recognize, of course, macroeconomic events could derail things. But at least for now, with this oil price range that we're in, it's kind of all systems go for a long time.
Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Look, I'm careful speaking for the entire industry. But I would say I have this, including Halliburton, very focused on running return -- businesses for strong returns over the long term, which is precisely what we all do. And I think that's good for our clients and it's good for us as well. And so, that level of visibility is not inconsistent with companies planning a future around how to make money for shareholders.
And that's what we're doing as well. And so, I think it's a very good setup for the rest of this decade, quite frankly, just because, a, we know there's demand; b, we are able to -- our whole value proposition around is how we collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. And this type of setup allows us to do that. The other thing that happens, though, when we run a business for returns is we don't overinvest in the business.
And so, we've told you kind of where our capex will fall and level of growth that we're looking at. And so, we're very thoughtful about the growth because we are keeping profitable international growth firmly in hand. And so, I think assets are tight and they'll remain tight for those very reasons. It's very natural economic reasons for an industry that's running their businesses for return, which is clearly what we're doing.
And then, I think our level of capex, the way that structured drives that level of thoughtful investment and manages the contracts that we win indirectly. And it also maximizes returning cash to shareholders. So, it's a very good environment in my view.
James West -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
OK. That's -- we certainly agree with that. And then, maybe a follow-up for me and potentially, I don't know if Eric is going to take this one. But the D&E margins, which I know are more levered toward international, where a lot of the volume growth is certainly going to come from.
And you're going to have natural operating leverage from that and inflation. It seems to be cooling somewhat so you should -- incremental should improve here. You know, where are you -- I know you gave this quarter guidance, but that's seasonal. Where do you anticipate margins? Or maybe if you want to talk about incrementals, however you want to discuss it, for D&E going forward as we go through '24 and into '25?
Eric Carre -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, Jim. So, to your point, if you just look at Q1, obviously you get seasonal effect. So -- but more importantly, looking at the year on year and the general trend of the D&E margins. So, first, I think it's worth noting, as Jeff mentioned in the script, that we had our best D&E margins in 15 years.
So, it means that a lot of the investment we have done in the last few years are paying off. So, what to watch really is the general trajectory of margins in the business. And for us, it's a matter of balancing revenue growth, improvements in margin, improvements in returns as we continue to invest in the D&E business. So, all of that to say that expect margins to continue to firm up as we get into '24.
And we're expecting our margins to be materially higher in D&E in 2024 than they were in 2023. Now, there might be some bumps along the road from one quarter to the next, etc. It's a business that typically tends to have a lot of moving parts. But directionally, margins will be higher in 2024 than they were in 2023.
James West -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Got it. OK, thanks, Eric. Thanks, Jeff.

Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. You may proceed.
Scott Gruber -- Citi -- Analyst
Yes, good morning.
Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Scott.
Scott Gruber -- Citi -- Analyst
So, Jeff, as I step back and think about the outlook for your U.S. business, it appears that you're on a pathway to establishing a business that will deliver more consistent and better free cash flow in the years ahead than we've seen historically, in part that's given the e-frac investment investment across the portfolio. So, I'm wondering if you'd just give some color kind of, you know, around that. We're seeing the consistency now.
If I heard correctly, the capex color doesn't suggest a material reduction in domestic capex into '24. So, curious kind of around kind of bending that curve lower and just kind of overall helping this business model that's much more consistent and less capex-intensive ultimately.
Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks. And that is precisely what we set out to do, and that's what's playing out now. And so in terms of a consistent business that generates strong free cash flow through the cycle, and that's been our intent all along.
With the way we bring Zeus fleets to market, the way we invest in North America broadly, we are very deliberate about how we maximize value over the long term in North America. And I think you saw that play out in the last two quarters as we've seen the market moving around. But nevertheless, steady drumbeat of execution and cash flow delivery by Halliburton. And I expect to continue that because that is precisely our strategy.
And so, when it comes to cash flow, our capital allocation of our capital budget, we're going to allocate it to those things where we see that opportunity, which we certainly see that with Zeus fleets. But remember, that's a demand pull, not a push strategy. So, we don't build fleets until we have contracts for fleets. And so, you know, that's a different -- completely different environment than maybe we would have seen in prior cycles from Halliburton, anything else we do in North America.
Like we've developed some very good, in my view, fit-for-purpose drilling technology for North America. But we're not going to overbuild it. We're selling it into the market as the market will take it. It's a lot of excitement about it, but our approach is still going to be consistent delivery of margins and free cash flow in North America.
And so, I think you'll see us continue to do that. And that means, you know, we put e-fleets in the market, we retire sort of the fleets that are at the bottom of the stack and continue that march forward.
Scott Gruber -- Citi -- Analyst
Got it. OK. Appreciate the color. Unrelated follow-up here.
Leverage is down to about 1x now, which is good to see. And it sounds like the cash return could step up a bit. Can you just kind of walk us through your thoughts as you move forward in time, the cycle continues, you'll generate more free cash flow, leverage continues to come down, you know, outside of any M&A, should we think about that shareholder return as a percentage of free cash flow moving higher, given that, you know, you will be trending somewhat on leverage on a go-forward basis?
Eric Carre -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean just starting with free cash flow, I think that you can expect 2024 free cash flow to be at least 10% over '23. So, that is going to basically help us return -- increase returns on a dollar basis. Now, in terms of the percentage, we're still guided by our overall 50% return to shareholder.
But directionally, it would make sense to believe that we'll do at least what we did in 2023 in terms of the percentage return.
Scott Gruber -- Citi -- Analyst
OK. Thanks, Eric. Thanks, Jeff.
Eric Carre -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler. You may proceed.
Luke Lemoine -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
Good morning, Jeff and Eric. Jeff, your North America rev significantly outperformed the U.S. land rig count in '24. And I would guess some of the factors were Zeus fleet, service quality, more stable customer base and a pickup in the Gulf of Mexico.
But could you talk about any other factors that drove this? And then, with the U.S. land rig count most likely down in '24, do you think North America revs could be up in '24 for you?
Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Look, the outperformance is just the stability of the business as I described it. And so a big part of that is 40% of our fleet by the end '24 under long-term contracts. That creates a steady environment.
So, the rig count is going to move around and do what it does, but our largest part of our business, very stable. And the reality is the North America business is very big. We saw growth Gulf of Mexico and other offshore environments. However, you know, a very large, stable North America business -- land business is going to mute some of that.
And as we go into '25, I expect the same kind of performance out of our North America business sort of in spite of what rigs do. Now, I do believe a repoint where DUCs are drawn down, they're largely drawn down. And I think that we'll see rig count increase only because it's supplying the inventory of DUCs required to run a very smooth, stable-type business. And I would say our customers largely plan their business around turning wells into production more than they do numbers of rigs in the air.
And so, I think there's a lot of planning that goes on to deliver a very stable business of completing wells. And so, I think one of the reasons I would say I'd take the over on rig count, I don't think -- I won't try to forecast rig count at this point. But I do think there's upside in North America. We plan the business for what we can see, and we expect it to be stable.
But that being said, I think there are obviously factors that could push that up. Like gas activity is clearly out there and I would pull the pace at which LNG plants come online, but we know that they will. Is it '24 event or a '25? I think we'll get to that point and see that Halliburton participates in that upside, and that could happen this year. But at this point, you know, we're planning the business around returns.
Luke Lemoine -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
OK. And I guess a follow-up with this more stable North American business, you talk about your North American land margins you're ascribing flat in 4Q. Could you talk about how you see this progressing in '24 kind of with that stable business?
Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Well, look, let's just leave it at steady and stable moving forward. I think that we've got a very strong international business as well that contributes, and I think that continues to grow and expand margins. But we're really pleased with where we are. But, you know, U.S.
revenue and margins flattish through any cycle, I think, is, you know, where we wanted to get this business. Clearly, there's upside. And I do expect from a C&P standpoint, we're going to see the benefit of our market leadership positions in PE, cementing, baroid and other things that we do around the world. So, I think that we're going to continue to participate in that meaningfully, particularly from a margin standpoint.
But again, our key in North America is stability through cycles. And I think we're demonstrating -- I don't think, I know we're demonstrating that now.
Luke Lemoine -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst

Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. You may proceed.
Stephen Gengaro -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen.
Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Stephen.
Stephen Gengaro -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Two for me. Wanted just to follow up on the prior question around sort of margins in C&P and the Zeus fleets. When you talk about these assets being contracted, are there any difference in sort of the pricing dynamic versus sort of prior cycles and price openers quarterly? And how should we just think about the pricing for those assets in an environment where maybe there's a little excess capacity near term from some, quite honestly, maybe not as competitive assets but older assets in the market? Does it matter -- is pricing pretty stable? Can you talk about that a bit?
Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Look, these are long-term deals that we go into knowing the cost of the asset and knowing what the return needs to be. So, now it just becomes a bit of a math problem around duration. And so, there are variable costs in the market that we don't control and we don't try to own. We just pass through to customers, whether it's sand cost and many other things.
But for -- where we create competitive advantage for our equipment is we go into these long-term vehicles. We don't need price opener and all of that sort of jazz. There's no reason for it. We literally sit down and work through what is the return for client, return for Halliburton, and then we fix that and move forward.
That doesn't change over time. And so, you know, the rest of the market, the spot-type market, all of that is going to do what it's going to do. But I think that's when we take a long view of the market in value creation, that's math that both clients and how can do. And I think that's what makes it so very different, our approach in North America.
You know, It's not particularly differentiated, if at all, in the spot market. And as a result, it's just kind of does what it does. It's on a free for all. But I would say, in the market where we want to play, which is technology-driven, lowest total cost of ownership and working on, I think, most important, which is productivity per foot.
That's a different game. That's a long-term game.
Stephen Gengaro -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Great. And then just one quick one, probably for Eric, on the cash flow statement. Anything we should know about working capital parameters in '24 versus '23 that would be much different as we kind of build out the models, whether it's DSOs or payables, etc.?
Eric Carre -- Chief Financial Officer
No. I think what's important around free cash flow for '24 is, as I mentioned earlier, is we're expecting the free cash flow to be at least 10% over '23. That's going to be on the back of improved income. It's going to be on the back also of improved efficiencies around working capital.
So, we spend a lot of time working on improving DSOs, working on improving DIOs. And when I speak like this, I don't mean just pushing the organization, I mean implementing different initiatives. For example, I'll give you a couple of examples on DSO. We spend a lot of time on automating the invoicing process on integrated services.
For example, invoicing on integrated service is extremely complicated. We have multiple product lines, multiple parts of our organization, customer organization, so it takes a lot of time. And to the extent that you can automate that and then remove -- reduce cycle time, then you improve DSO. We just rolled out 18 months ago a companywide demand planning software, which when combined with the rollout of S4 in the future is going to give us totally different capabilities to plan our business and reduce inventory while not increasing the risk from an operation perspective.
So, these are the things where we're spending a lot of our time to basically structurally improve the efficiency of working capital. So, that's going to be the other component of why we're expecting our free cash flow to improve next year.
Stephen Gengaro -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Excellent. Thank you for the color.
Operator
Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen. You may proceed.
Marc Bianchi -- TD Cowen -- Analyst
Thanks. I just wanted to first clarify on the North America outlook that you provided for it to be flat. That's a comment for the full year. Is that correct? Or was that a comment from where run rates are today?
Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Look, we think that Q1 is up from Q4. So, there's activity that comes back to seasonal in Q4. As we look at the balance of the year, I think that there are -- as we plan the business for what we got visibility of and we can see our fleets are largely contracted for '24, that's what we know. Are there factors that may add to that? I think -- if you have to do that, I think if production levels are low, clients may speed up.
There's a lot of variables that could happen that, I think, are to the positive. But nevertheless, as we look out to '24 and we plan a business that generates the kind of returns we expect to generate, you know, that's what we see.
Marc Bianchi -- TD Cowen -- Analyst
OK. The other question I had was on D&E in the first quarter here. I think, historically, there have been some onetime sales that continue for D&E in the first quarter. And then, margin could be down in the second quarter.
Is that sort of the base case outlook here? Or is there something unusual going on this year versus the prior years?
Eric Carre -- Chief Financial Officer
No, there's nothing unusual. I think if you -- actually, if you were to go back and look at the Q1 '24 over Q4 '23 guidance that we just gave, it is very much in line with the typical Q4 to Q1 seasonality that we saw prior to COVID, so you go back to 2020, 2019, 2018. So, what we're seeing here is really a business that's fully in line with historical trend. What's happening on the D&E side, the influence of software sales in Q4 typically is maintained in Q1.
But we're having a lot of weather-related issues in the Eastern Hemisphere and the North Sea, etc., that is influencing our D&E margins. But again, very much in line in terms of quarter-on-quarter guidance as we have had historically in our business, nothing unusual.
Marc Bianchi -- TD Cowen -- Analyst

[Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. You may proceed.
Kurt Hallead -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst
Hey, good morning, everybody.
Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Kurt.
Kurt Hallead -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst
Hey. A lot of good stuff to digest here to make. Jeff, appreciate all that color. I think my question here, kind of what piqued my curiosity was, again, a couple of things that you -- one of which you put in the press release, which was a kind of AI-driven dynamic that you have going on with ADNOC.
And maybe start with that one in the context of how you are seeing AI evolving as a tool for the customer base, as a tool for your company. You know, the -- how do you see the adoption of that? And how do you see the financial impact of that evolving over the course of the next couple of years?
Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Thanks, Kurt. Look, I think software and automation, and I say it that way because software business is strong and focused on enterprise solutions, which will adopt all sort of AI and generative AI as we continue to move forward. And that will create efficiency and [Inaudible] in a lot of ways for our customers.
Internally, as we adopt automation and AI into our tools and service delivery, I expect that it will have a meaningful impact. Probably over the next two, three to five years, just as those things are adopted, it's going to reduce service costs, it's going to drive demanding. And it's also going to improve service quality, and I think will actually improve the capability of tools, which I think is so fundamental to how we generate long-term returns.
Kurt Hallead -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst
Appreciate that color. Also noticed that Halliburton Labs entered into a venture to some direct lithium extraction. So, curious as to how you might see Halliburton, you know, get involved in that process as well.
Jeff Miller -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer
Well, look, that's one of our Hal Labs companies. We're excited to have them here. We make a very, very small investment in companies that join our labs, but it's very small. It's around $100,000.
So, it's -- we're a tiny piece of their Series B, which we're excited for them. But Hal Labs continues to attract, in my view, more quality investable companies over time. We're watching them enter Series As, and in some cases, Series B. And it's a journey.
We're doing a lot different industries, but we're careful. This is clearly not corporate venture capital. We are not investing in the companies that join Hal Labs other than small 3% to 5% stake that we get from them generally for the services that we provide to them as a member of Halliburton Labs. So, super excited about where that's going.
But, you know, we just need to let that continue to progress on its own.
Kurt Hallead -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst
All right. Fair enough. Thanks, Jeff. Appreciate it.

Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Dan, and thanks for joining us today. Macao delivered $654 million of EBITDA for the quarter. The number would have been $40 million higher if we had held, as expected, in the rolling segment. It's only been one year since the end of COVID in Macao.
We began in Q1 with $400 million EBITDA. In Q2, we did $540 million. In Q3, we did $630 million, and the growth just keeps coming. We look forward to continue growth in both gaming and non-gaming revenue, which will lift the entire market. SCL continues to own the largest share of non-rolling table win, rolling table win, and slot ETG win.
And most importantly, we have the largest share of EBITDA in the Macao market by a wide margin. We believe the completed London will meet and perhaps even exceed the earning power of the Venetian. Our future growth in Macao is tethered to these powerful assets, which will drive growth in the years ahead. Whether it's rooms, gaming capacity, retail, entertainment, and food and beverage, we have stellar assets.
Those assets will even get better as you complete the ongoing $1.2 billion Londoner reinvestment program. There has been ongoing speculation that the future growth of Macao. Can Macao market grow to 30 or 35, or even $40 billion and beyond? We believe that it will. This underscores our confidence in the returns that we generate by capital investment programs in our portfolio.
We are staunch believers in the growth of Macao market in near and long term. LVS has invested $15 billion in Macao to date. Macao is the most important land-based market in the world. A few reference points to consider: Fourth-quarter EBITDA, assuming expected hold on rolling play, represents considerable growth when compared to the previous quarters.
Our retail business in Macao has already far exceeded pre-COVID numbers. I continue to expect the gaming portion of our business to follow the same path as Singapore and accelerate in 2024. Let's pivot to MBS and Singapore. Seven quarters into our reopening, MBS delivered a $544 million quarter.
This is the largest EBITDA for one quarter in the history of the building. The power of this building is evident based on the results despite the disruptive impact of our ongoing $1.75 billion renovation. Disruption notwithstanding, MBS is hitting on all cylinders with gaming, lodging, and retail perspective: slots and ETGs at MBS approaching $1 billion annual run rate; nonrolling tables are exceeding $20 million a drop per day; ADRs are escalating; and the retail component is delivering far beyond pre-COVID numbers. MBS validates that quality assets prevail and that reinvesting in our assets will generate sustained returns.
MBS has it all, an iconic building with superb decor and service levels, which attract the most desirable customers in every segment. At the completion of both phases of the renovation program, MBS will feature 770 suites. We previously had less than 200 suites. There is no denying its future.
How far can MBS go? Our future expectation starts with $2 billion and beyond in EBITDA per year. As you know, we're bidding for a license in New York. We're receiving strong local support. The cost of the building will be in the $6 billion range, which enables us to develop a true five-star resort with unlimited people.
This is a massive opportunity. We are very enthused about the prospect. Our bid is compelling. If we receive the license, we'd be in the ground as quickly as possible.
Thank you for joining us today. I'll turn the call over to Patrick before we move on to Q&A.
Patrick Dumont -- President and Chief Operating Officer
Thanks, Rob. We wanted to highlight some changes in the materials that we typically provide for the quarter. After discussions and review with the SEC, we will no longer be presenting hold normalized adjusted property EBITDA in our press releases, SEC filings, and supplemental earnings materials. These changes are being made to our materials for this quarter and for reporting going forward.
We believe that the analysis of our financial and operating results in any quarter will continue to benefit from an understanding of the impact of expected hold in our rolling volume segments for our reported results. We will continue to provide the impact of expected hold in our rolling volume segments for our earnings materials. Please see pages 6 and 7 in our earnings presentation for an overview of the new presentation format. For this quarter, the quarter ended December 31, 2023, we generated 654 million of adjusted property EBITDA in Macao, a very strong operating result.
It is important to note that we held 2.16% in our rolling segment in Macau. EBITDA would have been higher by 40 million in Macao had we held, as expected, in our rolling segment. At Marina Bay Sands, for the fourth quarter of 2023, we generated 544 million in adjusted property EBITDA, another strong result. We held 4.57% in our rolling segment in Singapore.
EBITDA would have been lower by 71 million at MBS had we held, as expected, in our rolling segment. It is also important to address our margin structure had we held, as expected, in our rolling volume segments in Macao and Singapore. In Macao, our margins in the fourth quarter of 2023 would have been 35.9%, an improvement of 100 basis points as compared to the third quarter of 2023 if our hold was as expected in our rolling volume segment. At MBS.
had we held, as expected, in a rolling volume segment, our fourth quarter of 2023 margin would have been 48.8%, an increase of 170 basis points sequentially. It's important to note that both in Macao and Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, we are generating revenue growth, EBITDA growth, and when considering expected hold for our rolling volume segments, margin expansion. We are very focused on the quality of our offerings, on further investment to drive high-value visitation to our properties, on the resulting revenue growth, and on margin expansion over time. Looking ahead, we are excited about our progress in our markets, and we are focused on growth in the long term.
Let's move to the Q&A portion of our call. Thanks.
Questions & Answers:

Operator
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions.[Operator instructions] And your first question today is coming from Joe Greff from J.P. Morgan. Joe, your line is live.
Please go ahead.
Joe Greff -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.
Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Joe.
Joe Greff -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Obviously, the -- the premium mass had a significant sequential growth and exceeded the base mass. I was just hoping, can you talk about the progression of -- of base mass recovery throughout the fourth quarter? And then, clearly, what we're seeing out of information for the Macao market as a whole in January, month to date, is nice overall mass growth pickup. And as you said before, Rob, the -- the growth keeps coming. I was hoping if you can talk about sort of the relative performance of base mass in January and if we're seeing this hopefully anticipated pickup in that mass segment.
Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Joe. As you know, we don't comment on -- on the current quarter. The numbers speak for themselves, though. The -- the market appreciation sell in January, thus far, from publishing is very encouraging, doesn't it? A continuation of December.
As for our performance in Q4, I'll turn it to Grant to talk about the acceleration of base and premium mass. Grant?
Grant Chum -- Senior Vice President, Global Gaming Strategy
Yes, Rob. Thank you. Yes, Joe, the segment differential growth in the fourth quarter, we had 13% growth in premium mass and 8% growth sequentially on base mass. So, I think base mass was progressing nicely through the quarter.
It's just that premium mass had a great performance that exceeded that. If you look at the visitation trends during the fourth quarter, Macao actually recovered to almost 90% of 2019 levels on visitations. So, I think the base mass is continuously progressing and building up. Transport -- the transportation infrastructure has been improving. I think the demand to come, I think the desire to -- to take advantage of the non-gaming events that have been coming on stream across our properties, across the whole industry, have been very effective.
So, I think you should expect that -- that growth pattern to continue.
Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Grant, can I say also -- Grant -- Grant, can I ask, is it fair to say transportation and visas, the whole lubricant that supplies the market into Macao, is getting better? A year after COVID, it seems to me as if the ability to get their desires there but also the ability to get there is improving daily. Is that fair to say?
Grant Chum -- Senior Vice President, Global Gaming Strategy
Yes, the ability to get there has been improving, but the desire -- desirability of the destination is even clearer. You can see that the domestic flight to mainland, key greater Bay area airports has all but fully recovered. And if you look at our ferry statistics, passengers that we carried in fourth quarter recovered to 93% of pre-COVID but only 52% of our sailing capacity. So, clearly, people are enthusiastic about coming even though the -- the transportation capacity is still recovering.
And that's also clear, very gratifyingly, the overseas, the foreign visitation, recovered dramatically in fourth quarter, especially from Southeast Asia. And that's great to see from Macao. And that's despite the direct flights from foreign countries into Macao haven't -- haven't recovered even by, I think, 60% in the fourth quarter versus pre-COVID. But the visitation now is getting back up to 80, 90% of what it was before despite the -- the flight connectivity are still still catching up.
Joe Greff -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Great. And then, my follow-up --
Patrick Dumont -- President and Chief Operating Officer
Hey, Joe, before the follow-up, one thing important to note also, it's been a while since we talked about this, but we actually have capacity to absorb base mass business as it continues to come into the market. So, you know, when you think about the property portfolio that we have, the investment that we've made in terms of amenities, the tourism attraction for the base mass customer, the ability to service that customer in terms of food and beverage, shopping, entertainment, but also the fact that we have the capacity as that market continues to grow will be the beneficiary of that. And it's important to note because the market is not at capacity yet. So, as more visitors come in, in this base mass segment, we'll have the ability to absorb it. Sorry.
What's your next question?
Joe Greff -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Thanks. My next question is for you, Patrick. Obviously, it's nice to see half a billion dollars of buyback activity this past quarter. Do you view that as a sustainable level unless there's some huge volatility in the share price level?
Patrick Dumont -- President and Chief Operating Officer
You know -- you know, I think there was -- you know, I think there was some activity during the quarter. And to be fair, I think we looked at the -- the -- the share price levels as an opportunity. When we think about our future capital return, as we said before, we kind of expect our share repurchase will be more heavily weighted in dividends. And so, I think we fundamentally believe in the long-term value of share repurchases, the benefit of the compounding, the benefit of the share shrink, shrinking that denominator.
In terms of amount, I think it will be measured across time. You know, if you -- if you sort of look at our balance sheet, you look at the free cash flow we generate, we're going to look to be aggressive when we can. And I think we're going to run a program where we look to acquire shares consistently over time. But I think it -- you know, I don't know that we'll necessarily buy the same amount that we bought in this quarter going forward every quarter.
Joe Greff -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
OK. And then, one final thing. Congratulations, Grant, on -- on your promotion. That's awesome. Thanks.
Grant Chum -- Senior Vice President, Global Gaming Strategy
Oh, thank you, Jeff. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question is coming from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley. Stephen, your line is live. Please go ahead.
Stephen, your line is live. Please, you may go ahead with your question now.
Stephen Grambling -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Hey there. Sorry. Can you hear me?
Patrick Dumont -- President and Chief Operating Officer
Yes.
Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yes.
Stephen Grambling -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Sorry about that. So, you may have touched on this a little bit, but as we think about the renovations coming up for the remainder of Sands Cotai, Sheraton/The Londoner, can you just maybe help contextualize how that will compare to the first renovation, both in terms of disruption and then contribution?
Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I think we'll turn it over to Grant for that comment. Grant, Londoner.
Grant Chum -- Senior Vice President, Global Gaming Strategy
Sure. Thanks, Rob. Thanks for the question, Steve. I mean, I think we can say in terms of the timeline, we've already commenced the renovation of the Sheraton Hotel, and that will continue through the whole of 2024 and will hopefully complete sometime in the first quarter of 2025.
And, yes, there could be some impact from construction disruption, especially as we go into the second half of the year. And that a little bit depends on when the works are approved to commence on the Sheraton side, the casino floor and also as well as the number of keys that -- that will be out at any given time at the Sheraton. That said, I think we'll be managing this whole process just as we did in the first phase when we converted the Holiday Inn into -- into The Londoner starting in 2019. So -- so, we'll be -- we'll be well used to yielding the rest of the portfolio. As you know, the -- the yields we're getting at the Sheraton side of the building is -- is lower than the rest of the portfolio.
So, we will be trying to, you know, not miss any opportunity to -- to yield the rest of the portfolio while the works are going on. And this is something that we've been doing, throughout these existing building renovations. Right now, the schedule is still a little bit fluid, just pending some statutory approvals. But at this point, our expectation is the first half will -- will be relatively normal and then expect to see some disruption into the second half.
But then, by 2025, we're going to be in -- in a dramatically, elevated and different position. In terms of the entire Londoner, you asked about the phase 1 and phase 2 contribution. Well, we -- we have -- we have done the bulk of the work in the public areas and the externals, the facade in the phase 1 and -- and the retail mall and one of the two casino floors. But we only touched 1,000 keys, out of the -- the 6,000 that we have.
So, the main difference is that phase 2 is going to address the majority of the hotel inventory in terms of renovation and, of course, the other main gaming flow that we have on the Sheraton side.
Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Stephen, just following Grant's comments, I understand the market's concerned about London disruption. It's a valid point. However, two thoughts for you. One is that I think if the market continues to accelerate like we're seeing in January market numbers, perhaps we can overcome that by using other assets in the portfolio.
But secondly, to Grant's comment, I think when you see the eventual transformation of Londoner, it will be a juggernaut on par with the Venetian or beyond. So, it gives us two assets we think can probably make $3 billion by themselves. And while there's disruption '24, '25 and beyond gives us something that's unique in that market: the No. 1 and 2 assets -- or No.1 and 1 assets in that market for years to come. So, there may be some disruption, but maybe market force can overcome that.
But I think the end result is well worth the pain.
Stephen Grambling -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
That's all super helpful. Maybe an unrelated follow-up on -- on Singapore. Looking at least at the visitation data, it seems like it was mixed at best, but yet you're still seeing that market grow sequentially from an EBITDA standpoint, revenue. I guess, what are you seeing from China customers coming back to the market? Any initial read on how should we should be thinking about that building into next year?
Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
We should be thinking about --
Patrick Dumont -- President and Chief Operating Officer
I think I'm happy given -- oh, go ahead, Rob. Sorry, Rob.
Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
No, go ahead, Patrick. I'll follow yours. Go ahead.
Patrick Dumont -- President and Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. So, I think the key thing about Singapore is it's really about quality and tourism. So, we've been very focused on investment. If you heard us over the last couple of calls and what our investment thesis is, that the higher quality assets we have, the higher-quality tourism will attract.
And that's really on full display here. So, it's not about quantity, it's not about the full recovery; it's the fact that we're getting very high-value tourists. You know, if you look at Singapore as a market, it's incredibly attractive, right? It has a growing high net worth, you know, population. There's a lot of family offices moving there.
There's a lot of business activity there. There's political stability. There's strong tourism infrastructure. It's got a strategic location. All of those things are benefiting the Singaporean market overall and helping drive the business that weren't.
And so, for us, you know, there's been a -- there's been a ramp from China, that's true, but there's still a lot more to go. It's still, you know, let's call it, 50% on on visitor arrivals. You may have heard that at some point, they're going to go visa-free this year. We're hopeful that that actually occurs, which, you know, there's no way to know exactly how beneficial that will be, but it can't hurt. But I think the key thing is it's a very attractive market.
But it -- really the -- the results you see in this quarter in a building that was really under construction didn't have its full suite complement and didn't really have a lot of the amenities that we'll have in -- halfway through '24 and '25. You know, I think really speaks to the capability of the market and where this building can go. You heard Rob in his remarks about our view of the trajectory of this business. We're very bullish on it, but I think it's really just about high-value tourism. I wouldn't look at the absolute number of visitor arrivals and use the determining factor for where the business can go.
Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
I think Patrick's comments are spot on, Steve. We have limited -- we have capacity-constrained building in MBS. Unfortunately, we only have so many rooms and suites, which we had 10 times as much, but we don't. So, the mass -- the mass market tourism is as important to us as the right tourists to the market.
We look at this asset as a $2 billion asset today, annualized EBITDA, but we believe it can grow 10% to 20% over the next three or four years. And then, hopefully, we can finalize our plans with the government once the government blesses another building. But we believe that that could open later this year and make us a $3 billion projected EBITDA by end of decade in Singapore. So, we see ourselves now two going to 2.3, 2.3, 2.4 and eventually stepping up to $3 billion. We see huge growth in this asset. It's just beginning.
We got obviously hampered by COVID, but to watch it grow like it's growing, our only disappointment in Singapore is we just don't have more space because it's a very desirable market. And that building, probably the most valuable hotel building ever built in the world. And we'll just accelerate in the next three to four or five years until hopefully we can tell you with finality we have a deal in phase 2.

Thank you. Your next question is coming from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Carlo, your line is live. Please go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Thank you. Hey, guys. Rob, you touched on it a little bit just there, but I was wondering, obviously there's a ton of moving parts with COVID and everything else, but, you know, $1 billion in phase 1 at Marina Bay Sands returns on that product look to be very favorable; 750 million over 2024 and into 2025. I was wondering how you think about returns there.
And then, to your point there at the end of your last comment, when do you expect to kind of have an update around -- around the timing and perhaps the spend on the larger scale project there?
Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
I'll just reiterate how much we believe in Singapore as a market. My comments about $3 billion, we actually believe that's very attainable when we open this new building late in the decade. As for the update, Patrick has been right in the middle of that. So, Patrick, please take it away in terms of phase 2 Singapore.
Patrick Dumont -- President and Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. I think, you know, it's a -- it's an interesting comment. I think the key thing for us is that we are an investment-driven story, right? So, the more we invest in high-quality assets, the better service levels we have. The more we're going to have pricing, the more we're going to differentiate our product.
The more we're going to have high-value tourists, the more our EBITDA margins will grow. And so, you're seeing that happen in real time in Singapore. And so, for us, I think, you know, we'll finish the -- the third tower by Chinese New Year next year. That's 750 million will go in.
We'll solve some amenities that have to be done across parts of '25. But by the mid part of '25, we're basically going to have what is in effect a brand-new building. It's going to be fully renovated, and you'll get to see the full power of the suite product on the rolling side. You get to see the power of the premium mass and all the amenities that we have, the shopping, the entertainment, all the things that we're adding in terms of our premium mass lifestyle program that you can't get anyplace else.
These are all very positive things, and the quality of these amenities makes customers want to be repeat visitors. And so, for us, these investments will drive very high returns. That's the reason why we're -- why we were willing to do it. That's the reason why the board was supportive. You know, you can see the trajectory of EBITDA now, we're not even done.
So, we think tower 3 will be very accretive in terms of investment. You heard the numbers Rob just mentioned. We're very confident in those numbers. We feel very strongly that that's where we should be going. And then, in terms of the next building, IR 2, we've been in very close discussions with the government over many months.
There's a lot of moving parts here, a lot of things we have to satisfy. This is a project of national significance. We want to make sure that everyone's comfortable with it and that we get all the proper approvals. And we're hoping in the next quarter or two that we'll get everything done. We've been making good progress, we've been visiting Singapore, and we feel very confident where we are, and hopefully, we'll be able to get all the green lights we need and we'll be able to get going soon.

Your next question is coming from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun, your line is live. Please go ahead.
Shaun Kelley -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to offer my congrats to -- to Grant on the promotion as well. And maybe speaking of promotions, you know, Grant or whoever, if you could comment a little bit just on the promotional environment. I mean, I think this is a big question or theme that came out of the quarter -- you know, last quarter. And just sort of what you're seeing, particularly the upper end of the premium mass segment right now.
And, in general, are premium mass market margins consistent with your pre-COVID expected ranges, or are they still a little bit below that, and what would it take for them to recover? Thanks.
Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Grant?
Grant Chum -- Senior Vice President, Global Gaming Strategy
Shaun, that was good, by the way. Thank you -- thank you, Shaun, for the question. You know, I think -- I think if you looked at the competitive landscape, of course, it is very intense at the premium mass segment. But if you look at also -- at our margin structure, I think the way we've driven our business is no different from before, which is to really drive and elevate the product and -- and to drive the content and the -- the events that we put on across a whole range of sectors to attract visitors and patrons. And I do think that, back to Patrick's opening comment, if you look at that margin progression, underlying margin grew another 100 basis points.
We actually saw a good improvement in our mass margin sequentially. So, you know, we -- we -- we are dealing with the competitive market as -- as any competitor does. It is intense., but we believe strongly that, in the end, product wins. And Londoner and Grand Suite at Four Seasons are true, living, evolving testaments of that argument that good product wins.
And they are going to be fluctuations in the competitive intensity in particular segments at different points in time. But to have a sustainable competitive advantage and sustainable, profitable growth, product and service and the content we put into the resort calendar are still going to trump everything else. And you can see that through -- through what we've done at The Londoner is already at a run rate of close to 800 million as it was exiting the year. And you can see that the way this is going, we will end up with a margin structure, as we already are in Q4, at back to the same level as we were in 2019.
And then, as the revenues continue to grow, you should logically expect that margin to continue to improve and therefore exceed where we were in 2019.
Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
And, Shaun, just following Grant's comments, my experience has always been the same. Regardless of the market, great buildings and base variances always prevail. We have those in Macao. If you look at our EBITDA in Q3, I believe our EBITDA exceeds our next two competitors combined, which is quite a statement of the power of our buildings.
There'll be promotional issues occasionally here and there, but in the end, we have structural advantage which can't be undermined. We have more capacity for lodging, food and beverage, retail, entertainment, and gaming capacity than anybody in the South buy a bunch, and that will enable us to prevail both on margin and EBITDA basis. And so, yes, there'll be occasionally a promotional issue here and there, but it really shouldn't concern you as far as our business. Our margins remain intact, and our dominance remain intact in all segments in the county.
Shaun Kelley -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Thank you both for that. And then, maybe just as my -- as a quick follow-up, you know, last quarter, it was mentioned, you know, Grant, I think in one of your comments or one of your responses a little bit about a bit of an uneven recovery we were seeing coming out of some of the source markets from, you know, broader mainland China as some of the air travel's reopening. Wondering if we're continuing to see that uneven recovery or just any other broader signs of the kind of where the macro situation sits in China because, so far, and again, seems to be continuing through January, it seems like Macao is relatively unaffected there. But I want a sort of an update on that, you know, on that trajectory, if you could give one.
Grant Chum -- Senior Vice President, Global Gaming Strategy
Sure, sure. I think if you look at fourth quarter, it did even out quite a bit. I think if you look at Dan's, visitation from non-Guangdong versus Guangdong slides --
Daniel Briggs -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations
Page 20.
Grant Chum -- Senior Vice President, Global Gaming Strategy
Yeah. Thanks, Dan. We're catching up significantly on -- on the recovery rate in non-Guangdong. That said, it is still uneven in the sense that if you look at the breakdown by province, some of the wealthier provinces have recovered way beyond pre-COVID levels of visitations, particularly in the Yangtze River Delta.
Versus even -- even Guangdong, the recovery rate is actually much higher. But overall, I think you can see an evening out in terms of the recovery rate in Guangdong versus non-Guangdong. And then, also, I think the fourth quarter, the overseas, the foreign country visitation also started to to accelerate and even out as well against the -- the nearby region source markets. So, I think you are seeing, I think, a progressive improvement across -- across all these source markets.
You know, I don't know, maybe Wilfred, has anything to add on the -- on the China side in terms of the -- the economy.
Wilfred Wong -- President, Sands China
Yeah. Shaun, China is still recovering from the tough COVID period. And -- but what is evident is the company's quarterly performance has actually been trending well. We have seen, as, Grant alluded to, healthy growth in the number of visitors, especially from the non-Guangdong region.
Now, one observation is that when long-haul travels of Chinese travelers has not fully recovered, Macao is emerging as a top tourist destination for short-haul travelers from the Chinese mainland.

Thank you. Your next question is coming from Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Chad, your line is live. Please go ahead.
Chad Beynon -- Macquarie Group -- Analyst
Afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask one just about the retail portfolio. We've been hearing and seeing a little bit of pressure just kind of in the luxury retail space, particularly in Asia. Based on the numbers that you put out and, I guess, the -- the turnover rent that you collected, you're not seeing that, but how are you thinking about the recovery in retail? Are you getting the right customers in there now? And do you think this could continue to improve as visitation and overall spend improves in '25 -- or '24? Thank you.
Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
If you look at the deck on, I think it's Page 28 and 29, it gives you a pretty good look at our retail portfolio in Asia. And to be blunt about it, I could be unhappy with these numbers. It was $3,000 a foot in a 600,000-foot mall at MBS. Venetian was almost 2,000 a foot with 800,000 feet.
And of course, $9,200 a foot at the Four Seasons luxury and a mere 4,300 a foot on the non-luxury. So, the answer is we are seeing a retail portfolio that's approaching $700 million of contribution and growing. Of course, there's discussions out there, [Inaudible], about the slowdown globally, but it looks to me that our -- I spoke to David Sylvester, our retail expert, it feels like we continue to see opportunity to remerchandise and get better and better at the retail segment. We still believe that retail is a long way to go. Our buildings are a little different than other retail, and that we attract a higher-value customer both in Macao and Singapore.
As you referenced, the lack of supply in Singapore, soI think that mall just keeps appreciating and we keep remerchandizing it to be more effective every day, more luxurious, a more upscale. In Macao, we've got a work cut out for us and some of our buildings not there yet in the Parisian. There's some work to be done, but I don't know how you could argue with these kind of results, $677 million of contribution and it just keeps accelerating. It compares very favorably with 2019.
So, we feel very bullish about our retail prospects. And again, it takes work. David Sylvester constantly remerchandises these things to reassess the portfolio. He's got a lot of work to do. But the numbers, I think, are stellar.
And I think we'll continue to be stellar for years to come.
Chad Beynon -- Macquarie Group -- Analyst
Thanks, Rob. Makes sense. And then, just in terms of the hold, understanding that, you know, it's -- it's kind of random here in terms of luck or unlucky, has there been any difference in terms of gameplay? Or, you know, you talk about kind of the recovery from the Chinese consumer, and I'm speaking of -- of Singapore, but hold has been high now for three quarters. So, is there anything that could kind of lead to maybe an elevated hold in that market in the near term? Or should we expect kind of the -- the reversion to the mean that we've seen in prior quarters and years? Thanks.
Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
I think it's safe to say this business always runs on mathematics. The mathematics prevail. And I wouldn't take three quarters as a -- an ongoing trend forever. There'll be a dark day in Singapore.
We'll miss by $70 million because we take the highest-volume players in the world. And people bet lots of money. And some days, it goes with you, and some days, it doesn't. This quarter, obviously, Singapore went with us. But I would caution I don't think it's -- it's the bettors are changing.
In fact, if anything, there's more of them, more affluence coming out of Asia. And we're fortunate to have the capacity to handle all of it. But I don't think you can point to a change in betting patterns in either jurisdiction that would elevate or hurt the whole percentage. It will be -- will revert to the mean always. And Macao will come back next quarter probably and -- and do $70 million higher.
And Singapore may have a bad quarter. Grant, you may comment on that. That's how I see it.
Grant Chum -- Senior Vice President, Global Gaming Strategy
That's exactly right, Rob. And people have relatively short memories, but in the fourth quarter of 2022, there's like 100 million-plus adjustment on the downward impact from low-holded Marina Bay Sands. So, I think one or two, three, four, even five quarters is actually a relatively short period of time and sample size for you not to get, you know, potentially very random results that deviate from -- from the expected normal hold. But I think it's fair to say, yeah, the mathematics always prevail.
And given the -- the scale of our -- of our business, you know, over time, over one year, two years, I think we should stay very much within the expected range. As you saw in Macao as well, we had the first three quarters holding significantly above the expected main hold, and then fourth quarter reversed. And for the whole year, we -- we ended up at about 3.3%, which is exactly where we -- we expect it to be.
Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, going back -- yeah, just for fun, going back maybe eight, 10 years ago, we had a horrific number of quarters in a row due to a few players, I think was Indonesian or Malaysian, and we lost obscene amounts of money quarter after quarter to them. And some people on our board were concerned and they wanted to be sure. And we talked. We looked at everything and we were very comfortable. And there was a belief there for about for a while that these people were magical and couldn't be beaten, and they lost back their entire winnings and then some.
It always goes that way, and I don't think you can ever get too emotional about it. This quarter is very interesting to see the Macao miss and the Singapore overachieving, but in the end, the games stay consistent. Pairs and ties versus straight bets do matter. But the Asian gambler is special. and he or she shows up consistently.
And they -- and they're great customers. I wouldn't let the success of few quarters change your views on the mathematics of baccarat. We don't. So, thank you.

Robin Farley -- UBS -- Analyst
Great. Thank you. Two questions if I could squeeze it in. One is just any comments on, Chinese New Year, upcoming, anything with trends approaching that.
And then, totally unrelated, just your latest expectations for timing of a decision in New York. Thanks.
Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
I'll take New York first, Robin. The governor, Governor Hochul, I think, was this week, commented on making -- seeing something happen this year. I hope that's true. We're -- you know, as you know, we've been working in New York for quite a long time.
And we think we have a very compelling bid, but we don't have any great insight that will happen or not. We sure hope the governor is correct. And either way, win or lose, we have a decision calendar year '24, that's our hope. But I think it'd be silly to take any insight beyond the governor's comments. I think we just -- we work very hard in this project.
We believe we have a really good chance of getting one. But I don't give you -- I couldn't give you any guidance beyond that. Grant, Chinese New Year's, do you think you're going to be there for that? Will that be -- will the year of the dragon bring anybody in the building? I hope so.
Grant Chum -- Senior Vice President, Global Gaming Strategy
Well, the -- well, Robin, I mean, we can't really comment on the -- the current quarter. And obviously, booking windows are short here. But I think you can see, you know, from the December holidays, in these peak holiday periods, even though the end of December is not a big China holiday, it is in Hong Kong and some other parts of the region, but you know, the -- the -- the ramp up in demand during those peak periods was -- was -- was tremendous. So, hopefully, that -- that will be replicated through -- into this Chinese New Year as well. So, there's a lot of optimism and expectations that -- that this -- this will be a strong one, yes.
Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Robin, I do think December was -- Robin, I think December was really great tell of what might happen. Chinese -- December numbers that closed were just terrific. And again, you see the market numbers for January. So, we're very hopeful that the year of the dragon is a huge year for us and for the market.

Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brandt Montour from Barclays.
Brandt Montour -- Barclays -- Analyst
Good evening, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. So, in Singapore, on the phase 2, I was wondering if you could maybe remind us the total room count exiting the year. And then, specifically with regards to disruption cadence, you know, what is the quarter to quarter and overall year look like in terms of how that will flow through the -- the P&L?
Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Patrick, you want to grab that?
Patrick Dumont -- President and Chief Operating Officer
Yeah, so -- yeah, sure. So, I think when we finished the year, we were around 2,200 keys available. Next year, because the construction in T3, Tower 3, we're going to get down to the mid-1,600s in Q3, which is probably going to be our peak of disruption. But, you know, those rooms are smallest right now and really have our lowest yield.
So, hopefully, the impact will be minimal and we'll be able to yield because of the compression to higher-value customers. You know, the performance of Marina Bay Sands has been quite good, and we think we'll be able to yield up in the renovated portion of the building? Sorry, what was the rest of your question?
Brandt Montour -- Barclays -- Analyst
And sorry, so then, the ending -- the ending key count, when all is said and done with suites and normal rooms.
Patrick Dumont -- President and Chief Operating Officer
It's mid-1,800s.
Brandt Montour -- Barclays -- Analyst
Mid-1,800s. Perfect. OK. And then, as a quick follow-up, just a broader question.
We haven't really talked about non-gaming spending, and I was just curious if you could give us update on your efforts on that front and maybe how your outlook has evolved for the return profile as we sort of go into '24 on non-gaming spend.
Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
When you say non-gaming, can you be more specifically targeted? Retail, food and beverage, hotel?
Brandt Montour -- Barclays -- Analyst
Of course. Sorry about that. Yeah, with regards to the concession agreements.
Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Oh, I see, OK. I'm going to let Grant handle that, but I would I would say we are a little bit different than the rest of our competitors in terms of we've been spending money aggressively in Macao forever for 20 years on -- on entertainment and other things. We believe in it, it's a huge value-add. I'll let Grant take the question specifically.
But I think, again, it's important to note we are different animal than other people in terms of this concession. We welcome it. We've been doing it before the concession mandate. I think it's been very beneficial to our company. Grant?
Grant Chum -- Senior Vice President, Global Gaming Strategy
Yeah. Thank you for the question. Yeah, I think in 2023, we -- we -- we went very intensely on investing across all of the non-gaming categories that we committed to in -- in the concession. As Rob said, many of these categories are categories that we have been investing in and involved in for a very long time.
So, I think whether you look across entertainment, we had almost 80 shows that we put on during 2023 with some amazing record runs, attendance, obviously, firstly, with the Jacky Cheung concert in Cotai Arena; and then toward the end of the year, Hins Cheung , a singer in -- in Hong Kong and had a -- had a great 14-show run at The Londoner. So, it's probably set a new standard and precedent for -- for many residencies in Macao. And then, across other categories, in MICE, in art and culture, in -- in themed attractions, and gastronomy, across the board, we've been investing heavily. I should also give a chance to -- to Wilfred to speak to some of those events and projects that -- that we've been heavily investing in as well.
But suffice to say, versus our original forecast for what we would invest in the first year of the 10 years, we greatly exceeded that during -- during 2023. And we're looking to -- to -- to do so again in 2024. Wilfred, I don't know, something you want to add to -- to the non-gaming concession and investments we're making?
Wilfred Wong -- President, Sands China
Yeah, we -- we have, in the past years, been investing heavily in -- in the areas that Grant just described. And by a long way off, we are the leader in the MICE market. So, we are still seeing a very strong presence of MICE activities in our properties. For non-gaming, apart from the shows, we've been helping to promote Macao as a destination, not just for gaming; therefore, we have a lot of art exhibitions, cultural shows that really put us apart from the other competitors.

David Katz -- Jefferies -- Analyst
Hi. Evening, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll ask both in one shot.
If I could follow up on the -- the share repurchases, you know, Patrick, not asking about how much or when, but just thinking about how, you know, the -- the sort of family stake, you know, takes a long-term view and where you'd like to be, or how we might think about that evolving over time. And then, second, you know, since we last, you know, spoke on an earnings call, there's there's been an awful lot of activity and focus in Texas. And if you could, you know, share some of your views and thesis around, you know, what -- what -- you know, what the family's activities and how that might relate to the company and, you know, shareholders, you know, that would be helpful as well. Thanks.
Patrick Dumont -- President and Chief Operating Officer
So -- so, you know, I think, first off, I think we see value in both equities. So, we're very long-term bullish. You know, from a company standpoint, we're going to continue to be aggressive. As you said before, you know, focusing on investment for growth.
We see the success of our capital allocation programs, both in Macao, as Grant just described, in -- in Singapore, in driving growth in high-value tourism and in diversifying our amenities and by creating margin and revenue expansion. So, you know, we're very focused on investment for growth. That being said, we generate a lot of free cash flow, and we anticipate to generate free cash flow in the future that we'll be able to use to return capital to shareholders. So, I think the company will look to be aggressive and measured over time as we return capital shares through share repurchases to shareholders. I think, you know, we've always had a dividend, you know, aside from the pandemic, and I think we like having a dividend. We think it's helpful for shareholder returns.
We think it's an important component of our overall, you know, shareholder value strategy. But that being said, we're going to be overweight to share repurchases. In terms of -- in terms of Texas, I think the most important thing is that Las Vegas Sands is actively, you know, trying to facilitate the development of integrated resorts in the state of Texas and through the legalization of gaming. And so, we're very excited about it.
We think it's an unbelievable market. Over time, we hope that it happens. I can't tell you when it's going to be, but we're very focused on it as a company, and we'd like the opportunity to develop some very unique tourism assets, specifically in Dallas. You know, we think that's a great market.
We've been very focused on it, and we think the opportunity there would be a great one. In terms of the family's activities in Texas, I think we like the state. We're very obviously happy with our investment there. We're very excited about it. And we'll look to be a part of the business community there.
But in terms of LVS, we're very focused on bringing integrated resorts or destination resorts to the state of Texas and the development opportunity that would exist there.

Thank you. Your next question is coming from Dan Politzer from Wells Fargo. Dan, your line is live. Please go ahead.
Dan Politzer -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Hey, good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow up on -- on Sands China. And as it relates to capital allocation, your net leverage there, I think, is -- is -- is around three times at this point. It should be much lower than that as you kind of make your way through 2024.
How do you think about, you know, the subsidiary there resuming dividend payments up to the parent? And then, obviously, your stake went up a little bit through the quarter through those debt repurchase. So, maybe does that incentivize some -- some -- some of those dividends coming up sooner than later? Thanks.
Patrick Dumont -- President and Chief Operating Officer
Hey, if it's OK, I'll take that one. I think -- I think the key thing here, as I just mentioned in the prior question, and as Grant mentioned, as Wilfred mentioned, you know, we're very committed to investing in the long term in Macao. And so, our primary focus is going to be deploying capital there for growth. That being said, we are generating meaningful free cash flow there as we did in this last quarter. I think what you'll look to see over time is that some of the leverage that we put on the balance sheet during the pandemic will diffuse.
So, we have a maturity coming up in '25, we'll look to -- to see some of that and in front of the refinancing. And our goal is really to bring leverage down in terms of quantum, but then also, our leverage is going to come in naturally as our EBITDA expands over time, you know, which is our expectation. So, you know, I think once that occurs, we're going to start looking to begin the dividend again at the Sands channel. That's something that's going to be determined by the board there.
But I think, overall, it's something that we'd like to see. And I think the goal is to begin that dividend in the years ahead. It was a very strong dividend payer in prior years pre-pandemic, and we'd like to become an investment-grade name there, keep that investment-grade rating, invest for the future in terms of scale and scope to grow our business there, and then, you know, return excess capital through dividends to shareholders there. So, that's the plan.
Dan Politzer -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Got it. Thanks. And then, just for my follow-up, as you think about Macao, we've talked a bit about the margins and the improvement, more or less has been about 100 basis points quarter over quarter. As you think about kind of the trajectory from here, and I know you're on pace to get back to those 2019 levels, you know, how should we think about maybe the pacing of improvement? And do you think, you know, that that operating expense structure is really in place at this point, you should benefit from -- from scale here on out?
Patrick Dumont -- President and Chief Operating Officer
I have one quick comment then I'd like to turn it to Grant. We've mentioned this a few times in the past couple of quarters. I think the story of our margin expansion in Macao is going to be based on revenue growth. You know, as the market continues to recover, as tourism continues to recover, as more high-value tourists come online, they see the types of high-quality offerings we have, the experience, the amenities, and the entertainment that Grant referenced earlier.
We're going to continue to grow and expand our customer base, and that will lead to pricing, that will lead to expansion, that will lead to revenue growth. So, from that standpoint, I think our long-term margin view is expansion because of the investment and because of what we just described. But, you know, I'll turn it over to Grant to see if has some additional comments.

Yeah, Patrick, I think you -- you covered it well. I think it's -- it's dependent on revenue growth as the market continues to grow and will be more than a full participant in that market growth. The margins will have a positive trajectory. I think we -- we obviously have a more efficient and more productive cost structure today than -- than -- than we did in 2018 and 2019. So, we will and are benefiting from that as revenues grow and you get the operating leverage on the fixed costs.
We will continue to do so. And I think it is very much about, you know, how revenues grow from here. And as revenues grow, our margins will have further upside.
Dan Politzer -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Got it. Thanks. And congratulations on the promotion, Grant.
Grant Chum -- Senior Vice President, Global Gaming Strategy
Thank you very much.

Thank you. Your next question is coming from George Choi from Citi. George, your line is live. Please go ahead.
George Choi -- Citi -- Analyst
Thanks for taking my questions. My questions were answered earlier, but I do have a housekeeping question. Would you please remind us how [Inaudible] rent mechanism works at the [Inaudible] properties? Should we expect a normal uptick in the [Inaudible] that is when you guys receive the total rent? Thank you very much. I will jump back to the queue.
Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
I'm sorry, George. I think we missed that. Could you repeat yourself? It was unclear. There was some difficulty with static.
Daniel Briggs -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations
[Inaudible] the line.
Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Can you try it again, George, about Macao?
George Choi -- Citi -- Analyst
Apologies. I just wondered how the turnover rent mechanism works in -- in the Macao properties. Is it a fourth-quarter event, is that when you receive your total rent?
Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Grant, you want to help with fourth-quarter turnover in retail?
Grant Chum -- Senior Vice President, Global Gaming Strategy
George, there are leases that are on monthly turnover rents, and there are leases that are on annual turnover rents. So, historically, what happens is for those annual turnover rent leases, as -- as we get into third quarter, the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we will -- we will obviously be recognizing more of those turnover rents as we hit the annual sales targets. So, historically, you should expect seasonally the second half of the retail rental revenues will be higher than -- than the first half.
George Choi -- Citi -- Analyst
OK. Understood. That's all I have. Thank you very much.
Rob Goldstein -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Before we finalize the call, I just want to reach out and recognize the great contributions of Wilfred Wong, who's now executive vice chair. Wilfred has been with us about eight years and made a great contribution. Wilfred, congratulations on the elevation to executive vice chair. Grant Chum, well deserved.
We hired Grant many years ago. The big concern was, was he old enough to win the casino at that time. And over the years, he's aged sufficiently, so now you're now going to the casino. Congratulations to Grant. Both you guys have built a terrific team over there.
We're very proud and grateful for your efforts and look forward to many more years of working together. Thank you for your time today and interest in our company. We bid you adieu.

Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Great. Thank you, Allison. Good afternoon, everyone. As we usually do, we will start with our shareholder letter and open the call to questions.
To our people, partners, and shareholders, net revenues of $751 million were at the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter, and adjusted operating margin of 7.3% was slightly below expectations due to higher-than-anticipated expenses, including international openings as well as costs related to our pending acquisition of the New York Guesthouse property and unsuccessful efforts to secure the iconic One Ocean Drive Miami Beach location. While pleased with improved demand trends generated from the launch of our new RH Interiors and RH Contemporary collections, we experienced increased headwinds in early October when mortgage rates peaked above 8%, and the Hamas invasion of Israel triggered the war in the Middle East. With 82% of homeowners having mortgages below 5%, and 62% below 4%, we continue to expect the existing housing market to remain frozen until interest rates and/or home prices fall meaningfully. Additionally, the home furnishings market has become increasingly promotional, and we believe that will create -- we believe that will create a mix shift toward clearance products, pressuring gross margins.
In light of the current market, we are delaying the mailing of our RH Modern Sourcebook until the first quarter of fiscal 2024 when we believe demand conditions will likely be more favorable. As a result, we are narrowing our revenue guidance range for the year to $3.06 billion to $3.08 billion, and now expect adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 13.6% to 14%. As mentioned, we are in contact -- contract to make an opportunistic purchase of the New York Guesthouse property for approximately $58 million, scheduled to close in the fourth quarter. The building was appraised at $85 million last September when the Federal Funds rate was half the level it is today.
We believe controlling the outcome of this one-of-a-kind property is in our best interest. However, we will be poised to take advantage of any opportunity to do a sale-leaseback with the appropriate investor when the commercial real estate market rebounds in the future. Product elevation. We expect -- we expect our demand trends to accelerate though the first half of 2024 as our product transformation unfolds, in-stocks improve, we complete the reset of our galleries, and introduce our new Modern and RH Outdoor Sourcebooks in the first [Audio gap] of next year.
We anticipate our inflection point will peak in the second quarter of 2024 as our new collections fully ramp and we begin another cycle of Sourcebook mailings, completely transforming and refreshing the entire brand over a 12-month period. We believe our latest collections reflect a level of design and quality inaccessible in our current market and a value proposition that will be disruptive across multiple markets, positioning RH to gain market share throughout fiscal 2024. While a product transformation of this magnitude will be margin dilutive in the short term, we believe it will become margin accretive over the long term as selling rates stabilize and allow for supply chain and sourcing efficiencies. Platform expansion.
Our plan to expand the RH brand globally, address new markets locally, and transform our North American galleries represents a multi-billion dollar opportunity. As discussed last quarter, we introduced RH to the U.K. this past summer in a dramatic and unforgettable fashion with the opening of RH England, The Gallery at the Historic Aynho Park, a 17th-century, 73-acre estate that is a celebration of history, design, food, and wine. We had a spectacular turnout for our opening event, and the global press coverage the brand received was multiple times greater than any gallery we have ever opened.
Due to RH England's countryside location, we expect the majority of the revenues to be driven by our interior design and trade businesses, which are -- which are dependent on building books of business with high-value repeat clients like interior design firms and hospitality projects. The quote book and demand continue to build monthly despite the seasonal nature of the location. Our first U.K. Interiors Sourcebook was in home in October, and our next contact planned to be our RH Modern and RH Outdoor Sourcebooks in the first quarter of 2024.
In November, we opened two new international galleries, RH Munich and RH Dusseldorf. The response to our opening events was beyond our expectations, with Munich hosting over 900 chic attendees roaming three floors with Cipriani Bellinis and Vesper Martinis, and traffic in both galleries has been strong since opening. Although RH England is our most unique and spectacular gallery to date, and the only one with a hospitality component in Europe, all three are architecturally impressive, multi-level expressions of the RH brand, only to be outdone by our even more impressive teams in each location. While many retailers boast of a capital-light franchise or licensing approach to international expansion, we believe the only way to build a brand and optimize the business globally is to invest into, and control the brand, in the same manner we do locally with people who live and breathe our values because it's their values; people who will lead our cause and build our culture because it's their cause, and it's their culture.
We believe when you aspire to be the very best in the world, there are no shortcuts, and greatness can never be delegated nor licensed or franchised. Our next international openings include RH Brussels, The Gallery on the Boulevard De Waterloo; and RH Madrid, The Gallery on the Plaza Marques De Salamanca in the first half of 2024, followed by RH Paris, The Gallery on the Champs-Elysées in the fall of next year. RH Paris is one building from the corner of the Avenue Montaigne, known as one of the most exclusive and luxurious arteries in the capital and the chosen home of the major haute-couture brands such as Chanel, Dior, Vuitton, Celine, Saint Laurent, and many others. We believe the space we have designed for this location will position RH as a placemaker and pacemaker in the luxury fashion capital of the world.
RH Paris will be a six-floor jewel box connected by a dramatic, ornate scissor stair and a central glass elevator that will whisk you up to the fifth floor and rooftop Champagne & Caviar Bar, where you can take in views of the Eiffel Tower while enjoying our innovative menu featuring the finest Petrossian Caviars. You can also visit the second floor and dine in our dramatic atrium restaurant, inspired by the Grand Palais. With an onyx-carved bar, floors, walls and tables looking out into the beautifully landscaped courtyard with 30-foot ivy-covered walls, it's like dining in a secret garden, erasing the noise and chaos of the outside world. Mark your calendars for early September, RH Paris will be an opening party you won't want to miss.
We are also under construction in London and Milan in inspiring spaces that will celebrate the heritage of the historic structures and will integrate full expressions of our hospitality experiences. Our current plans call for opening both galleries in 2025. We are also anticipating gaining local approvals soon for RH Sydney, the Gallery in Double Bay, with plans to open in late 2025 or early 2026. Regarding our North American transformation, we opened RH Indianapolis, The Gallery at the DeHaan Estate, one of the most accurate Palladian-style villas ever built in the United States.
The estate spans 151 acres and over 60 rooms, looking over a 35-acre lake, and represents one of the largest, most inspiring, and immersive physical expressions of our brand to date. With construction delays pushing RH Cleveland into the first quarter of next year, our plan now includes opening five North American design galleries in 2024, inclusive of RH Palo Alto, RH Cleveland, and RH Raleigh in the first half of next year, and RH Montecito and RH Newport Beach in the second half. We also believe there is an opportunity to address new markets locally by opening design studios in neighborhoods, towns, and small cities where the wealthy and affluent live, visit, and vacation. We have several existing locations that have validated this strategy in East Hampton, Yountville, Los Gatos, Pasadena, and our former San Francisco Gallery in the Design District, where we have generated annual revenues in the range of $5 million to $20 million in 2,000 to 5,000 square feet.
We have secured our first new location for a design studio in Palm Desert, which should open in the first half of 2024. We have identified over 40 locations that are incremental to our previous plans in North America and believe the results of these design studios will provide data that could lead to opening larger galleries in those markets. The RH business vision and ecosystem, the long view. We believe, ""There are those with taste and no scale, and those with scale and no taste,"" and the idea of scaling taste is large and far-reaching.
Our goal to position RH as the arbiter of taste for the home has proven to be both disruptive and lucrative, as we continue our quest to build the most admired brand in the world. Our brand attracts the leading designers, artisans, and manufacturers, scaling and rendering their work more valuable across our integrated platform, enabling RH to curate the most compelling collection of luxury home products on the planet. Our efforts to elevate and expand our collection will continue with the introductions of RH Couture Upholstery, RH Bespoke Furniture, RH Color, RH Antiques and Artifacts, RH Atelier, and other new collections scheduled to launch over the next decade. Our plan to open immersive design galleries in every major market will unlock the value of our vast assortment, generating revenues of $5 billion to $6 billion in North America, and $20 billion to $25 billion globally.
Our strategy is to move the brand beyond curating and selling product to conceptualizing and selling spaces, by building an ecosystem of products, places, services, and spaces that establishes the RH brand as a global thought leader, taste and placemaker. Our products are elevated and rendered more valuable by our architecturally inspiring galleries, which are further elevated and rendered more valuable by our interior design services and seamlessly integrated hospitality experience. Our hospitality efforts will continue to elevate the RH brand as we extend beyond the four walls of our galleries into RH Guesthouses, where our goal is to create a new market for travelers seeking privacy and luxury in the $200 billion North American hotel industry. Additionally, we are creating bespoke experiences like RH Yountville, an integration of food, wine, art, and design in the Napa Valley; RH1 and RH2, our private jets; and RH3, our luxury yacht that is available for charter in the Caribbean and Mediterranean where the wealthy and affluent visit and vacation.
These immersive experiences expose new and existing customers to our evolving authority in architecture, interior design, and landscape architecture. This leads to our long-term strategy of building the world's first consumer-facing architecture, interior design, and landscape architecture services platform inside our galleries, elevating the RH brand and amplifying our core business by adding new revenue streams while disrupting and redefining multiple industries. Our strategy comes full circle as we begin to conceptualize and sell spaces, moving beyond the $170 billion home furnishings market into the $1.7 trillion North American housing market with the launch of RH Residences, fully furnished luxury homes, condominiums, and apartments with integrated services that deliver taste and time value to discerning time-starved consumers. The entirety of our strategy comes to life digitally with The World of RH, an online portal where customers can explore and be inspired by the depth and dimension of our brand.
Our authority as an arbiter of taste will be further amplified when we introduce RH Media, a content platform that will celebrate the most innovative and influential leaders who are shaping the world of architecture and design. Our plan to expand the RH ecosystem globally multiplies the market opportunity to $7 trillion to $10 trillion, one of the largest and most valuable addressed by any brand in the world today. A 1% share of the global market represents a $70 billion to $100 billion opportunity. Our ecosystem of products, places, services, and spaces inspires customers to dream, design, dine, travel, and live in a world thoughtfully curated by RH, creating an emotional connection unlike any other brand in the world.
Taste can be elusive, and we believe no one is better positioned than RH to create an ecosystem that makes taste inclusive and, by doing so, elevating and rendering our way of life more valuable. Never underestimate the power of a few good people who don't know what can't be done. For the past 23 years, we've heard others tell us what can't be done, and for the past 23 years, we've failed to listen. We avoided bankruptcy while being accused of lunacy.
While others have been shrinking and closing stores, we've been building the largest and most inspiring spaces in the world. When Wall Street didn't think our stock was worth buying, we bought 60% of the shares ourselves. When everyone told us we should be working from home, we were in the center of innovation, working on rebuilding our new home, our brand, and it's almost ready for primetime. From the largest product transformation in our history to the most inspiring and unusual retail experiences in the world; from couches to caviar; beds to bellinis; architecture to airplanes; homes to hotels, I should say guesthouses; from Pittsburgh to Paris, Los Angeles to London, Boston to Brussels, Miami to Munich, San Francisco to Sydney, soon the world will be within our reach.
Never underestimate the power of a few good people who don't know what can't be done, especially these people. Onward, Team RH. Carpe diem. Operator, we'll now open the call to questions.
Questions & Answers:

Operator
Thank you. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Simeon Gutman -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Hi, everyone. Hi, Gary, Jack, good afternoon. I want to ask about contemporary. I know it's early.
I think some of the research was that it shouldn't cannibalize other aesthetics. I don't know how much data you have on it yet, but is that fair, and how sales are progressing? And then, I don't think -- can you just remind us, you'd never -- you never touch pricing on contemporary. I know we talked about changing some pricing on some items, but I don't think it ever related to the new collection. Thanks.
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
You know, we -- we reviewed kind of pricing and, you know, our value equation throughout the brand. So, everything was touched. I mean it's -- if you look at the contemporary brand -- the contemporary book, this remailing of the book has -- has got a very high new content. So, but all the products kind of been -- I don't think there's anything we didn't reprice. So, yeah, yeah.
But -- but look, the contemporary book got in mid-October -- early to mid-October. It kind of hit right as the war was breaking out and interest rates peaked, so it's hard to kind of see the initial reaction to it. You know, there's collections like -- like any collection, there's collections that are selling really well, some are selling good, some not so well. You know, I -- I feel very confident of the, you know -- the overall mailing of contemporary is going to be incremental, you know, as we believe interiors have been, and as we believe modern will be, and as we believe couture upholstery will be, and bespoke furniture will be, and everything we do, you know.
So, you know -- so, look, we couldn't be more excited. We're -- you know, we're sailing into the, you know, probably one of the biggest headwinds any of us have, you know, experienced in the housing market. You know, while it's not the Great Recession of 2008 and '09, it is -- from a housing point of view, you know, it's that bad. So, you know, you're -- you're lapping, you know, really big down numbers in the housing market and they're still down, you know. So, you know, you got a little lift in the new home market, but that's only 10% of the market. So, you know, we've got a -- you know, as I said, you know, in this latest shareholder letter, and I said last time, we'll continue -- we should continue to see our -- our business inflect, you know, through the -- the rest of this quarter and into -- you know, through the first half of next year and hit an inflection point, I think, kind of mid, late to second quarter.
And that'll be despite kind of the housing market, unless there's, you know, something where there's another gap down. But -- but it seems -- you know, it seems that they've got inflation somewhat under control. you know, it seems like the Fed becoming more confident. And, you know, if we can start to see a move in interest rates and easing and interest rates, the Federal Funds rates, and, you know, the mortgage rates, that'll help.
You know, while mortgage rates went down a little, you know, you still -- you still have a affordability issue with, you know, 82% of the people with mortgages at 5% or under, and 62% 4% or under, and 25% are under 3%. So, that's the biggest issue facing the market today, you know, and -- and that's why we don't have inventory. There's not inventory in the housing market and why prices -- prices aren't coming down because there's not inventory. You know, there's some pricing coming down here or there in some markets. But, you know, the good news for us is, you know, we -- we're just taking a long view.
We're trying to position the brand in the business, you know, for the next big run. And, you know, and I think we're going to be meaningfully better positioned than anybody else in our sector; you know, not by a little; by a lot, you know. Like, when this -- when this housing -- you know, we'll outperform, you know, the market and the competition, I think, over the -- you know, the next period. You know, we gave some market share back. You know, that during, you know, the post-COVID period, we haven't been promotional like everybody else got.
Everybody got on the other side of COVID, and everybody got promotional, even though people say they're not promotional or they're not doing sitewide promotions or whatever the language is, you know, just on people's websites. You know, it's a very promotional environment out there and has been. And I think what you're seeing now is -- is the people that got promotional are now going to lap their promotional stance, and they have to go up against that. So, that was the lever post-COVID for people to, you know, turn on the promotions list. The business now everybody's cycling that, and you know, I think you're going to see people's -- as you're seeing it, people's in businesses inflecting downwards in this environment and our business is inflecting upwards, and it will continue to do so.
Simeon Gutman -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Can -- can -- as a follow-up, can you talk about your own inventory position, the ratio of, I know, discounted or clearance items, because you mentioned the shifting to that could weigh on margin? And if you have stuff that needs to be cleared or contemplated to be cleared, does it make sense to tactically move it and move it out of the way to make way for all the new product that's coming?
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
We -- we are. We just don't want to lead with -- with clearance and lead with pricing. I mean, we'll -- we'll have a few emails that go out there that talk about, you know, end of year -- you know, end-of-year sales to, you know, to -- to deal with the -- with the clearance goods. And so, stuff like that.
And we'll be aggressive pricing those goods. So, we, you know, get the inventories cleaned and, you know, turn inventory into cash. We don't want to sit around on the balance sheet. So, yeah, you'll see us take the -- you know, the -- the appropriate action here. And, yeah, so you know, but nothing we wouldn't normally do.
We -- we just don't want to lead with promotions or start to, you know, turn the business back in that direction. We're -- we're almost to the other side of this thing. I can't believe -- you know, maybe -- maybe we've got another six to 12 months, but I think, you know, you get to the second half of '24 unless -- again, unless they haven't got inflation under control, I think we're going to see, you know -- we're going to see the -- the Fed take -- you know, take an easing approach. I would be surprised if they left interest rates at these -- at these levels the entire year next year. But nonetheless, even if they do, you're going to see us perform pretty well in any environment based on, you know -- just based on the work we've done and what's in the pipeline and the plans we have, and they're all very big moves. This is, by far, the biggest product transformation in the -- in the history of our industry. It's multiple times bigger than anything we've ever done.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Steve Zaccone of Citi. Your line is open.
Steve Zaccone -- Citi -- Analyst
Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on operating margin, and I wanted to talk about -- ask in particular about your ability to protect the operating margin.
You know, we're now at a level that's below 2019. You know, granted the macro is challenging, but can you just talk through your comfort with protecting operating margin? What are some levers that you can pull if the macro deteriorates further into next year?
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I mean, you know, we're not going to have a strategy to protect operating margin. I mean we're -- you know, you're -- you're comparing it to 2019. Are you kidding me? No, like, why would you do that? It's nothing like 2019. We're in the biggest housing downfall that anybody has seen, you know, so...
Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer
Massive, massive inflation since that time.
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah.
Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer
On so many items of P&L costs.
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so that's not where I'd be focused. You know, like, I mean you can focus there, you just -- you'll just miss everything that's going to unfold here, you know, if you want to focus on that. I mean, we're -- we're investing for the next cycle. We're investing for the long term.
We're not trying to protect the operating margin a point or two. I mean if -- if that's going to get people really fired up about the long-term strategy of this company, it's probably the wrong shareholders.
Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer
And, Steve, the -- you know, just one thing to comment about, again, you mentioned lever, but just more of a point of -- of a tailwind is that -- you know, that we have elevated markdown activity this year. That -- as we cycle through that next year that, you know, that could unveil itself as a tailwind next year. So, we'll talk more about that in March.
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, yeah.
Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer
But, you know, that's one -- one aspect that's positive.
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I mean the operating margins are going to be fine. You know, so you know, the cash flow is going to be fine. We didn't -- we didn't buy back $2.2 billion worth of stock, you know, because we think the model has a problem. You know, we're going through the biggest transformation in this entire industry, you know, and so you want to think about what's going to be on the other side of that, not what's the operating margin in the next quarter or two.
Whether that bounces around at point or to, like, that's not -- as big a shareholder in this company, that's not what I'm worried about.
Steve Zaccone -- Citi -- Analyst
OK, fair enough. Follow-up then on just the promotional aspect to the furnishings industry, how -- how long do you think that lasts? Is that something that continues, you know, for the next couple of years, or is it something that probably is finished by the end of '24?
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Oh, you mean just the broader industry?
Steve Zaccone -- Citi -- Analyst
Yes.
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, no, I think the broader industry is back to pre-COVID, you know, pricing and promotions, and it'll be there forever now. Once you turn that on, you can't go back. So, you know, maybe the -- the emails look different or they call them different, but you know, you go look at the websites that -- I mean go -- I mean you're getting pelted with sale emails, you know, and have been for over a year. And that's why, you know, like I said, that's why everybody is now cycling that. And, you know -- so, you know, there's easy business.
We could -- we could have turned on promotions over the last year and the other side of COVID and moved our business 15 to 20 points. It just would have permanently created a different model. And so, you know, look, some people are promoting and cutting ad costs, some people are doing a lot of different things and hoping they have a massively different model. I -- you know, there might be people that come out of this thing with a -- with a slightly better model. Maybe there's some things they learned, maybe they don't have to spend as much in ad cost, maybe this or that. So, but it's -- it's not really people that we compete with that I -- you know, that I'm too concerned with.
I'm more focused on, you know, what we are doing and what our big strategies are, and, you know, how this business is going to be positioned, you know, for the next, you know, five years. And, you know -- and we really like what I see. I think this is -- this is the -- the best work we've ever done, you know. So, what you're going to see unfolding over the next several quarters and -- and not just -- it won't stop there. Well, I say that the inflection point, you know, will peak in Q2, that's just based on what's in the pipeline.
What's coming on the next cycle likely will create higher and higher peaks, right, because we're -- we just -- you know, we're creating an entire new -- entirely new foundation for the business, you know, a stronger, bigger, better foundation to the business, you know, where we got arrogant about around pricing during COVID and, you know, we had all the -- you know, the price increases from the tariffs and then the supply chain, you know, raw material goods going up, you know, we're just a lot stronger. And we're going to play a very aggressive, you know, game because we can't -- we have the scale to buy bigger than other people. We have to scale to get better pricing. We have the platform to present it. And so, you know, where I think we've -- we lost the market share because we were, you know, slow to kind of ramp back up, you know, the product development and marketing of the business post-COVID, you know, we rebuilt those muscles.
You know, where we were arrogant from a pricing point of view, there's no arrogance anymore. There's, you know, just an incredible competitive focus to win. And so, now -- and the market's going to do what the market does. I don't know if I was, you know -- I -- you know, all the people that are out there that have been promoting this past year, what are they going to do, stop promoting, their business will go down 15 to 20 points.
Yeah, you know, try not promoting the furniture business when you've been promoting, like, it just doesn't work. You have to go through a whole year cycle like we went through when we moved to membership. You know, that's a -- that's a painful thing to do. And, you know, you have to be someone who owns a lot of the company like I did; otherwise, you're going to be a CEO that's under attack by activists. You know, you go through a transition like that.
So, you know, there's people that say, ""Oh, we're going to do like an RH membership model,"" good luck with that. You know, it's -- they're not easy things to do. You know, we spent three years planning -- planning that and transitioning the business and the model. But, you know, to stop promoting when you've been promoting -- you know, you're back on that promotional drug, I -- you know, it's -- you can't just get off it.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Chris Horvers -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Thanks. Good evening. So, a couple of questions on the gross margin. So, you know, do -- once we get past holiday, do you think it'll be clean to start '24? And is it fair to say that the vast majority of the non-fixed cost deleverage in gross margin was clearance? And to your comment, Jack, is there any reason why you wouldn't get that back? Presumably, with all the newness, you wouldn't expect a lot of markdowns.
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I think -- like, I think transition out, right?
Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Look, starting there, we're going to be in a better position than – than -- than, you know, let's say the start of the quarter. But I think we'll -- we'll be going through -- continuing to sell through the markdown goods, you know, by the -- by the end of the first half. You know, that's probably --
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I mean, we'll always have some -- some level of -- of markdowns, right? But what you want to think about what is -- what does the overall mix look like. So, the mix is going to be a -- you know, a heavier markdown mix, you know, in Q4, and you'll have some of that move into Q1. It'll probably lighten up, and it lighten up in -- in Q2 as we sell down. And you're going to have -- as the quarters go, you're going to have a higher mix of new, you know, higher-margin product. Yeah, so while I said in the letter, you know, over the short term, it's margin -- the transformation we're making is margin dilutive, but long term, it's margin accretive.
You know, it's a mix shift, you know, as the inventory rebalances so...
Chris Horvers -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Got it. And then, one of the questions we also get from investors is, you know, trying to think about there's a lot going on with all the new galleries and the accelerations -- accelerations of the books -- the sourcebooks back to what it was, you know, pre-COVID. As you think about what's implied here or the -- the third-quarter SG&A dollars is -- like, is that the right base? I guess, said another way, does advertising -- is there any reason advertising steps up again next year? And if you think about, you know, the complexion of the openings next year with more international, are --are we just sort of naturally raising the expense base, you know, given those two factors?
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, well, I mean, when is the perfect time to guide next year, we'll -- we'll guide next year. So, we're not guiding to next year right now. But, look, we -- you know, there's always going to be certain start-up costs, right, when you're ramping up new countries and things like that, you know, and investments to get the galleries up and running, to get people trained, to get restaurants opened, to get the home delivery network set up and operating and people trained, and then you'll cycle those things, right? So, you know, are we going to have some -- yeah, some -- some cycles to get around as we open different countries? Yeah, sure. But once, you know, businesses ramp, you know, you cycle those things.
So, yeah, I -- we -- we have a lot of confidence in long-term margin, you know, the business and -- and the model. So, you know, I don't think there's any reason why this -- you know, why this, you know, business and brand doesn't get back into the, you know, 20% range as, you know, we cycle through. I mean you're not going to get there in one of the worst housing market. This is -- I mean, you know, we compare the exact numbers to 2008 and 2009, but this is -- this is -- if it's not the worst, it's the second worst in my career. And I think I've been doing this as long as anybody leading a company in this industry. You know, there might be some people that have been doing along with me.
I don't know too many, but I haven't seen a market like this, you know, and how to navigate through, you know, a housing market downturn like this, you know. So, you know, I -- I can't remember when people were, you know, locked into low interest rates and they can't step up because, you know, different interest rates. So, you -- you got to kind of look beyond this kind of temporal time. I can't believe that we're going to be in this lock-up like this forever. Like, could it go through '24? It could.
So what? It doesn't change the long term, you know. And -- and we're -- you know, the good thing is we -- we've now cycled around. So, we -- we didn't bite on the promotional, you know, drug like everybody else did. So, we gave -- we, you know, we gave -- gave away some market share because we didn't do that, but at the same time, we've sharpened our value proposition at regular price. And we're going to be tough to compete with, you know, even if people go on sale.
You know, people don't -- they just don't have the buying power or the platform to present it that we do. And so, you know, I wouldn't want to be on the other side of this -- this big move we're making.
Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer
And, Chris, you know, you asked about Q3 being a base, you know, we don't look at it as a single quarter as a base. You've heard me talked about -- if you're going to, you know, try to read some trends on a base and, you know, look -- look for full four quarters given the -- given the cadence of advertising timing and -- and the --
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, you can't. Like, it --
Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer
You can't just use a quarter.
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I mean we used to be able to mail a book and we amortized it over, you know, six or 12 months. Now, you mail a book, and, you know, the day you drop it is the day the ad cost hit. So, you know -- and obviously, you know, the book's more valuable than that single period, but, you know, there's just an accounting rule change that, you know, is going to make a business like ours kind of lumpy, right, from, you know, quarter to quarter based on, you know, the ad cost hitting when the book drops. No -- no amortization of the ad cost, which doesn't make sense.
You know, you're not going to get all the sales that week.

Your next question comes from Curt Nagle of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Curt Nagle -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Great. Thanks very much. Just kind of a quick one, more of a clarification than anything else. So, just in the share letter, there was a comment about reaching kind of a peak inflection point in second quarter next year.
Is that in terms of kind of a ramp, is that demand trends, you know, flow-through revenue? Just if you could specify that a little bit more for me, that would be really helpful. I'd appreciate it.
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, yeah, that -- that'll be, you know -- that'll be demand trends, you know, which will turn into revenue. And, you know, there's going to be just continued step-ups. You know, there's going to be step-ups as we get in stock. There's going to be step-ups as we finish the gallery transformation.
You know, there's -- anytime you -- you know, you're -- you have big moves like this, you're going to have some things, some collections that are just wildly better than you could have thought. And you're not going to have -- you know, we -- we -- we have a collection here that is the best collection in the history of our age by probably 40%. We're not going to catch up on the inventory until March, April, somewhere around there. You know, so -- you know, there's -- there's -- and we -- you know, you've got all these imbalances when you have this -- this much newness. So, you've got to kind of rightsize all that you've got to get in stock, because, you know -- because things like that in other collections and things are selling so well, you can't even put them in the stores, right? So, if you've got too much demand, so you've got to fill the demand.
So, you know, some of the products that you're -- you're planning to transform the galleries with now is blown out. And then, you've got to let, you know, the manufacturing base, you know, just get their legs underneath them with all this newness, right? And, you know, they're going to get more efficient. You know, and things are just -- the flywheel is going to be running. You know, we will then have it.
You know, we're going to have the second round of the book mailings, which is going to have another -- well, I mean modern is going to be massively new, but then, you know, all the books will remail in the first half. We may -- you know, modern because we're pushing a little later, may -- may -- may go, you know, in the third quarter, but -- but all those books will have another probably an average 20% to 40% more newness based on what's in the pipeline. You know, so, it's like -- we usually have 15% to 20% newness. And so, you know, it's the -- basically, the entire brand is going to -- it's going to transform, and the assortment is going to expand on top of that. And so, you just got to kind of, you know, get it all dialed in, get all the inventory balanced, you know, get it -- get everything set.
You know, some things that you planned, you're going to put in the -- in the -- in the -- in the galleries -- in the retail galleries. And also, the demand doesn't look good, and you're like, ""Oh, let's swap that out with something else,"" and so, you know, you're -- you know, you're reading and reacting to real data now. And so, we like what we see in the data. You know, we like what we have in the pipeline.
We -- we like when we -- you know, we dimensionalize all the trends and all the data and say what does this all look like three months from now, six months from now; when this happens, that happens, that happens. And, you know, that's when we think we'll work for this big transformation, that's when we should start to reach peak inflection.
Curt Nagle -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Got it. And then, just a follow-up for Gary. Comments in Germany were interesting, right? A lot stronger, it sounded like, than you'd expected. I don't think you put a ton of marketing behind it, so what drove it? I mean, you know, the -- you know, at least seeing online, you know, the, you know, great locations, you know, beautiful exteriors, all the rest of it, but in terms of just this response, what's resonating? And, you know, anything you could say in terms of just, I don't know, I guess the potential relative to some of the -- I guess the average size in terms of revenue for U.S.? If you could size it, or it's too early?
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I think, you know -- I think just in general, we're in highly populated, you know, shopping areas, right? So, you know, in Dusseldorf, we're on the main shopping boulevard, you know, dead center across from Chanel, you know, a few doors down in Hermes. You know, just the -- the main luxury shopping street and we're dead center, you know, so there's a lot of people walking by, and a lot of people walking. In -- in Munich, you know, we're right in one of the key parts of town, you know, and where there's a lot of people. And you really can't compare those to what we did in England, right? Like, what I -- you know, I've said since the beginning, England -- we didn't do England through a lens of commerce first; we did it through a lens of conversation first, how do we create the right conversation of the -- with the brand, how do we make the right first impression, how do we do something that's so extraordinary, you know, it -- it gets the high-end luxury consumers to look at us differently, think about us differently, you know.
So -- so, England is really a -- you know, it's a big brand investment, but there's not a lot of -- there's no one walking by that store, not -- not a single human is walking by. You get to drive there. It's an hour and 45 minutes out of London. I mean, the business is built.
We just -- we just closed our -- today, we closed our biggest sale yet. It's 330,000 for chalet work.
Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, in the French Alps.
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
In the French Alps. It's a chalet in the French Alps. But, you know -- so, you know, the book of business is building; the design business with our -- you know, our internal interior designers is building, with our trade clients is building, you know. All those pieces of business are building nicely. And what's funny, I really thought this time of the year, it's going to -- it's going to go slow because, you know, the weather's not that nice out there right now.
And, you know, it's not like you're walking around the grounds unless you've got heavy coats and, you know, some rubber boots and stuff. So, but -- but our -- our demand and our -- and our book of business and everything is building still month over month. And, you know, so the branch is -- you know, it's going to take a while for the brand to just people know, we're here and know who we are and what we're doing. And, yeah, remember, people only buy furniture really every, you know, kind of five to 20 years, right, depending if you bought another new home or what you did. So, you know, you don't generally just go out to furniture stores, you know, unless -- unless there's a need.
So, you know, what -- you know, RH England just doesn't have the traffic of, you know, the locations that we have in Germany. And so, this is just our first look at the locations in Germany, and we like what we see. We like, you know, the people that are coming in, you know, they're starting to engage our designers. They're starting to learn about the brand. Some know about the brand, some have lived in America and now live in Germany. And, you know, some of -- they are telling us that the opening part of Munich, you know, a couple -- how they shipped their own -- been shipping their own containers to Munich, and now they're so excited we're here, you know.
They're, you know -- and, you know, so we had a lot of fans. I mean I -- what I was -- I think beyond my expectation was just the excitement for the brand and the quality of people that were at the opening events. It was -- I mean it was as good as you could have expected. And so, you know, that again -- that's again, bringing another conversation those people telling their friends and others.
You know -- you know, you just, you know, let that, you know, start building. And, you know, I would expect these countries are going to probably have pretty big compounding comps for the first three years, you know, much bigger -- you know, like in in America, when we open a new store, even if we're not in the market, we already in that market, where RH, like, we can open in Milwaukee, you know, next month, and we don't have a gallery there, but we do millions of dollars in Milwaukee. People are shopping from us, you know, online, they know the brand. And so, you know, when we open in a place like that, you know, people are lined up, ready to shop.
There's people that have been shopping, are there, ready to place transactions and place orders and you have immediate demand. I think in these new countries, you know, people are going to come in and get to know us. And, yeah, we'll start working on -- you know, they'll get to know the brand. We'll start working on -- on design projects.
And, you know, and then people will get familiar with who we are, what our prices are, you know, how we compare and -- and start to interact with us. But it'll -- it'll happen faster in Germany than it did in England, you know, like there's just not that much traffic. I mean we did catch, you know, the back half of the summer, and so, you know, we did have some really high-quality traffic out there. You know, but -- but I think, you know, what I -- what I'm amazed by RH England is that the demand is building, you know, into the slow season. I'm like, ""Huh, that's interesting,"" you know. So, you know, so we like that.
And -- and we've only mailed one book, you know, and not to that many people. So, you know, just learning about how you invest in -- in marketing and advertising and building the brand. Can it be a lot to -- you know, a lot to learn here for us, so -- but, you know, we like what we see. I mean I'm -- you know -- you know, pleasantly surprised, you know, how the business is continuing to build in RH England. I'm really happy with just the initial turnouts for the events and -- and then the amount of traffic just coming into the galleries, you know, just exploring and coming to see us, you know. So, you know, the demand -- you know, if that's happening, the demand will then start building, right? So, we'll see.
But, you know, we're going to know a lot more every quarter, you know, every six months, every year here.

Your next question comes from the line of Max Rakhlenko of TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Max Rakhlenko -- TD Cowen -- Analyst
Great. Thanks a lot. So, in the letter, you noted being pleased with improved trends from the launch of interiors and contemporary. So, just curious if you could frame the uplift in the context of revenues down 13 and change.
And then, how should we think about the magnitude of growth in the next couple of quarters from those two collections? And bigger picture on contemporary, Gary, what's your latest thinking around how large this collection can become?
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, you know, it's -- it's funny, we -- you know, we -- we don't primarily look at it -- you know, it's really what we look at as kind of one giant assortment packaged in different vehicles, right, that allows it to break through and, you know, present an aesthetic, and so on and so forth, to the consumer, but it's not like we sit here and go, how's contemporary doing, how's interiors doing, how's this. We say how's the -- you know, the upholstery business doing, and we're looking at every sofa in the entire assortment, whether it's interiors, contemporary, modern, you know. So, it's not so much the books from how we manage the business, with books to how we present it to the consumer. We look at the entire RH assortment, right, and then we're looking at, you know, the books they're in and, you know, how we're going to adjust and what's working and what's not working, and, you know, so on and so forth. So, you know, so I -- you know, when you think about it from the way you're -- you're thinking about it, OK, well, that -- you know, with that assortment, you know, when you parse it out, how big will it be? It's going to depends on how big we make that book; how big we make that assortment, you know; how many things we put into contemporary; or how many things that wind up going into interiors; and how many things go into modern, you know, because you've got some things that, you know, the lines are blurred. We could put it in almost any of the three books, you know -- you know.
So, I -- you know, I think about the way -- the way I think about this today is RH is going through a massive product transformation. It's the biggest thing they've ever done. You know, how does the whole thing look, you know, and as the whole assortment gets out there, interiors, contemporary, modern, outdoor, right; as the books get out there, as the products get into the galleries, as we get -- you know, get in stock, what does that total assortment look like, and how it's -- how is it performing versus the old assortment? We think it's going to be meaningfully accretive.
Max Rakhlenko -- TD Cowen -- Analyst
Got it. That's helpful. And then -- no, that's -- that's -- that's great. And then, I guess can you speak to the -- the phasing of the new products to galleries and your confidence of completion by the end of the first half of '24? And then, specifically, will -- will all the galleries be touched? Will some get more newness than others? Or how should we just think about the totality of the -- in gallery -- in-gallery resets?
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
You mean the -- the – the resets -- oh, the floor resets? Yeah, I think you know, they're being done in stages. You know -- as, you know -- as we're ramping up inventory -- and it depends again. It's that, you know, if you're ramping up, if you have -- if some really high-performing collections, you're just not going to be -- you're going to have to fill demand and not put the goods in the galleries, right? You're going to have to wait. And so, I'd say we're going to get, I don't know, 90% in stock in Q1 or something as far as --
Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer
The completions of the floor sets, probably a March time frame.
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah.
Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer
Not -- it wouldn't be the end of the quarter, but rather, where we sit today, it'll be March.
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, and some -- some galleries will get, you know, prioritized versus others. And, yeah, I think it's -- it's -- you know, I think we'll -- we'll be in really good shape by the end of Q1, you know, and into Q2. And, you know -- and then I think by mid to end of Q2, it's -- that's why I say that should be our kind of inflection point, I mean, based on all the numbers we're looking at today. You know, we don't have data on modern yet.
We won't until we mail that, you know, so that'll have you know, same kind of challenges. Lots of new product, we're going to -- you know, with any new product when you don't have data, you're going to be 100% wrong with your inventory investment. Like, I've been doing this a long time. I've never seen anybody buy new product exactly right. So, it's -- you're going to be a little overbought, underbought, a lot overbought, you know, underbought. And, you know, so because you just don't -- it's, you know, you don't have exact science, you don't have any trends on any of the newness.
So, you know, it takes -- takes a few quarters to kind of, you know, get the trends, you know -- you know, read the trends right, make the adjustments you need to get the on orders corrected, you know, make less of this, make more of this, and you know, let the factories get adjusted, you know, as they're ramping up on a lot of new products. So, yeah -- but, you know, that -- that'll all work itself out. You know, I just think about this as like, you know, the next couple of quarters will be meaningful. If -- if we're sitting here, you know, at the end of Q2 and we didn't get the inflection point we needed, that would surprise me, you know, that we think we're going to get.
It's not a little one. You know, it's going to be meaningful. That's going to keep building, you know, as all these things happen in stocks, gallery sets, you know, that modern, outdoor, and then a recycling and remailing of those books with more newness, right, with probably 30% to 40% more newness. And -- and then, you'll have some adjustments with that 30% to 40%, but -- but that will be much smaller compared to what we're doing today.

Your next question comes from a line of Steven Forbes of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.
Steve Forbes -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst
Hey, Gary, Jack, maybe it might be a repetitive question on the product transformation, but Gary, really just hoping you can -- you know, if there's anything you can give us or speak to whether it's sort of what you're seeing now or, you know, even a reference point back in history on sort of prior product transformation cycles, that could help us contextualize, like, what -- what the potential magnitude of the inflection that -- that it -- on the horizon is, and, you know, whether we -- whether we can reference sort of peak demand during COVID, or just anything that helps us think through, you know, really what should we be expecting behind this product transformation.
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
I think it's all going to depend on what -- you know, what the macro is doing in the housing market. Yeah, so -- and the housing market stays where it is, I mean, again, we -- let us guide you next year, you know, like, you'll get a better sense, you know, so , you know -- and we'll have a little bit more data. But, you know, I -- yeah, I just say, generally, I'd be surprised if anybody's outperforming us when we get to Q2 of next year, right? I'd be shocked. Now, maybe someone will shock me. I don't think so.
Steve Forbes -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst
We will anxiously await that. And then, just a quick follow-up, the 70 new collections that were referenced sort of in past calls, where are we today with the number of collections that are out? And how many will be launched by spring next year, by fall next year, what does sort of the -- the pipeline look like?
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, there's -- there's more than 70 now, you know. So, you know, the -- we'll have, probably when modern -- you know, with modern hitting and outdoor hitting, it will probably be somewhere between 70 and I'd say up to 90 and, you know, with more in the pipeline. And we have -- we have a whole 'nother book we're working on, you know, that we haven't announced yet, so you'll -- you'll hear about that, that we think it's going to be meaningful. And it's not -- it's not bespoke, it's not couture; it's something we haven't -- we haven't talked about.
And that's going to be a whole new big thing. So, you know, so we're working on that too. Yeah, so just a lot coming, Steve. Buckle up.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser of UBS. Your line is open.
Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst
Good evening. Thank you so much for taking my question. Why do you think you are losing market share? And if it's an issue with pricing, how much more do you think you need to lower prices in order to stabilize or gain market share?
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I don't think we're -- we're -- well, I -- I mean, did you miss the whole first part of this conference call? And I'm -- like, I can repeat myself, you know. The one that -- the transformation is in the early stages. The goods aren't in stock. They're not in the galleries yet.
We haven't been through a full mailing cycle, you know. And -- and I -- I -- I don't believe -- you know, I think we've massively closed the gap. I think we're gaining market share in a lot of people today. And, you know, there might be a few people out there, you know, that are outperforming us at a demand point of view. I mean there may not outperformance, you know, in the next quarter, to say there's going to be an inflection very soon here, you know.
And -- and so, what do we have to do? Everything I just said, you know, so I -- I don't think you want me to repeat myself, do you? Like, you know, I don't think we got to lower our prices anymore. I don't think we've got a -- you know, the goods just got to get in stock, we got to get the galleries reset, you know, and we got to go through, you know, the next cycle, and you know, we'll be off to the races, so.
Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst
My -- my follow-up question is -- my follow-up question is on the degree to which your P&L this quarter benefited from lower freight and transportation costs. Was that more significant? Could you, A, quantify it? And B, was it more significant than the P&L had experienced in the second quarter? Thank you very much.
Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer
Michael, we've talked about this a few quarters now. You know, we've given our turn and, you know, the way, you know, Fernando and his team, you know, attack ocean freight where, you know, where the bulk of the increases in costs had occurred through -- through the pandemic, you know, we -- those turned over last year, right? We peaked in May, as far as the highest contracted rates we've ever seen, and then every month thereafter, it's been a decline. And now, you know, in most -- many markets were back to or close to 2019 levels, right, Fernando? So, you know, we -- as far as, you know, kind of any kind of, you know, product margin impact from -- from freight rates, I mean, we're -- we're, for the most part, cycled through that given -- given our -- given our --
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, we're not really seeing a benefit right now. I know other people are. I think they got -- they got stuck, you know, in longer contracts with bad freight rates than we did.
Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, we were just more nimble at accessing the spot market and taking advantage of the decline in ocean freight rates that really began last June, I think, June, July. So, we're -- I wouldn't say there's any really that's quantifiable, or if it is, it's de minimis for Q3.

Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Matuszewski of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Jonathan Matuszewski -- Jefferies -- Analyst
Hey, Gary. Hey, Jack. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one was just a follow-up on RH England.
You know, great to hear the demand continues to build. A while ago, Gary, you mentioned the 50 to 250 range for first-year revenues was possible. Obviously, the backdrop has changed a lot. But, you know, what you've seen in the first six months and the sequential trend? How should we think about, you know, what you're internally expecting for -- for an annualized first-year volume? And appreciate it's more about, you know, conversation than commerce but just trying to think about how it's annualizing versus expectations. Thanks.
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, you know, I don't know if we had any real expectations. You know, when people said like what could it be, could it be, you know, I don't know, it could be 50 million, it could be 250 million. And that's -- you know, I'd think about it as, you know, we're going to keep kind of marketing the brand, right, to -- forget about RH, you know, that -- that gallery; think about that country, you know, and, you know, what -- you know, what will our investments in marketing do to the direct business, what will the brand recognition do, how -- you know, how does it build, you know, when do you get to, you know, certain run rates? I just think it's super early for us to know because we didn't open a typical store, right? If we were to open in London first, it would be massively different. You know, we opened in the countryside.
We try to do something, you know, super inspiring and something the world's never seen. And so, you know, make an investment. It's like -- it's just -- I wouldn't get too focused on this gallery, right? You know, this is -- you know, try to draw a conclusion of this one. It's not going to -- it's not going to tell us -- you're not going to get the right answer from this one, right? This is really a brand investment and to create the right first impression and the right conversation. You know, London is going to be coming around the corner. We're looking at other locations in other parts of England, and we're going to be investing in marketing, right, and not just books but other types of marketing, to drive the online business.
But we're just in the early stages of all that. You know, just like I'm telling you, don't get too obsessed with RH England from that telling us what the market is going to be for us. I'm not too obsessed about that because it'd be the wrong place to draw conclusions from. You know, it's like, has anybody opened a store like that in the world in any category? Somebody, name something similar to that. Just think about that, like if you've seen it, if you've been there, you know -- you know, anybody on the call, you know, if you haven't taken a look at the pictures, have you ever been to a retail store like that? No.
So, if you try to draw things -- we're not going to really do another one like that, right? You know, so don't -- you know, like we've got other things like seeing how, you know -- how does Germany build? That's a lot more normal. You know, we're -- we're on streets where there's a lot of people walking, by driving by, you know, so on and so forth. It's just a different -- you know, they're two different objectives and goals and visions, right, and strategies for the two. They serve two different purposes. So, you know, did I think RH England, you know, like there's a number I always had, you know, and, you know, it's a modest number and we're, you know -- but, you know, like what -- what you don't know is, OK, when you open up a brand to an entire country like England, how does that go, how does it grow, what marketing do you have to do, you know, beyond RH England? We're still learning, so, you know -- you know, we're not in a hurry to jump to any conclusions on any of this.
We're really happy with the work we've done, with the team we have, you know, with the initial, you know, feedback we're getting from consumers, and the kind of people that are coming, and -- you know, and all that looks directionally, right. So, you know, over time, it'll take care of itself. That's really, you know -- yeah, yeah, just you know, England is it's own thing, there's nothing like it in the world. That's why we did it, to get people to see something they've never seen, think about our brand in a different way, you know, have people at the, you know, highest levels of, you know, the -- yeah, economic, you know, ladders like, you know, who are shopping the best luxury brands in the world and stuff look at us differently, think about us differently. Yeah, so, they're all -- they're all long term.
You know, things like that, it's really a long-term investment. It's like a guesthouse. You know, we opened what we believe is the highest-quality hotel experience in New York City, if not one of the best in the world. I'm not looking at that thing to really tell me am I going to roll out a lot of guesthouses now. I'm just trying to communicate differently about a brand to build something that no one has ever built before.
Yeah, it's like somebody just wrote a report that I thought was one of the most comprehensive reports written about our company. Went all the way back to the very beginning, wrote about everything, wrote about RH music, you know, when we had a record label and we were -- you know, we did a concert at the Greek theater and we did, you know, performances and all of our new, you know, new galleries. And we had RH Contemporary Art, and we owned the Rain Room, you know, the most exhibited art exhibit in the history of MoMA New York and the history of the LACMA New York. And, you know, I remember being at the Goldman conference and someone asking me about RH music and, you know, this and that and the like, you know. And I said I -- you know, it's just a different way of communicating. I could go run ads and -- digitally or in print or do anything and – and, you know, like I don't know how do you really measure those returns? If it was that easy, you know, if everybody -- if everybody had really great data on digital advertising, don't you think everybody would have a really high-performing business? They don't -- I don't know how much to spend.
They don't know what they're getting for any of it. You know, Google and other people try to give you great things to, you know, make you spend more money. You know, look -- look what you're going to find out. Like, they clicked on your name. Like, you don't know if they clicked on your name because they came in your store or, you know, or how they got there.
You know, it's, you know -- but it's just a different way of communicating and building a brand. If you're going to build something unlike anything anybody's ever done, you don't take the same path as them. But we got here, and we did things like RH Music. And we had three artists for, I don't know, three years, and, you know, we produced albums and we did concerts and we did other things. And I think people thought it was really cool, and it made our brand look different and had people think differently about us, like, who are those people, you know.
And, you know, we did RH Contemporary Art, and we had the Rain Room. Yeah, first piece of art we brought but became the most attended exhibit in the history of the world. I mean, we're not always going to get it right, but I'll tell you, anybody who's been to RH England thinks differently about RH, and thinks about, ""Huh!,"" you know, those are pretty interesting people. And yeah, we're trying to build something special.
It's just not a game plan to anybody else's running because they're all running the same game plan for the most part. We're running a different one. So, at different times, it's going to be hard to look at, hard to model, hard to understand, but that's how it should be, by the way.
Jonathan Matuszewski -- Jefferies -- Analyst
Great, thanks -- thanks, Gary. And then, just a quick follow-up on product, a lot of discussion about disruptive pricing ahead, and just kind of curious how you're able to achieve that while preserving margins. So, you know, any color you could give us on -- on how the materials or the finishes or the sizing of pieces in the new collections is going to be evolving would -- would be helpful. Thanks.
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I mean, well, it's just -- it's -- it's because of our scale and buying power and confidence. And, like, if you look at -- you know, you look in our sourcebooks or you look online and you look at the Jakob chair, for example, and if you go look at it everywhere else and look at the pricing, and you look at our pricing, and you look at our assortment, and you look at our presentation, you know, you might have an ankle biter here or there. And someone just, you know, bought 20 shares and they -- you know, they're not making any money and they're going to, you know, match our pricing. But there's -- there's no one that can really buy as much as we can. You know, there's no one that can present it, you know, on a platform as big as ours and, you know, mail as many books as we do and get behind it.
And -- and you know, and a lot of people, you know, don't place the financial bets we do on product. We do that very well. That's how we got to where we are, you know. So, you know, if you -- I mean we've got people who are selling, you know, their version of the Jakob chairs and they pulled it off their website because their price was so embarrassing. And they already owned the inventory at a much higher price, and now, they don't know what to do.
So, they're probably sending it to an outlet. And they know who they are. They're probably listening to this call. And, you know, if you look at anybody selling the Jakob chair, you know, whether it's the cane Jakob chair, the upholster Jakob chair, the leather Jakob chair, the dining chairs, the lounge chairs, I wouldn't want to be competing with us in that chair.
And the margins are as high as anything else that we have. So, it's not necessarily a lower margin when you think of disruptive pricing.

Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.
Seth Basham -- Wedbush Securities -- Analyst
Thanks and good afternoon. My question is also around the product transformation. Understanding there's a ton of newness and a lot going on here, but as we think about modeling it, you know, you mentioned that's going to be margin-dilutive near term. Will that switch to accretion as the sales and select in the second quarter, or is there a longer ramp to the margin accretion?
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, should.
Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer
It should.
Seth Basham -- Wedbush Securities -- Analyst
All right, that's reassuring. And then, the second question I have is just regarding the ramp in Europe. Understanding those galleries will take longer to ramp as the brand awareness is more limited than in the U.S., but how should we think about the ultimate margins and ROIC of those new European galleries, putting RH England aside?
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, you know, it's -- it's not that many, you know. Like, we're just going to -- we're going to get them open. You know, we're going to learn a lot. We're going to focus on how do we build our business in these different countries and what kind of marketing investments they take and what they look like, you know, right? It's not -- yeah, you know, it's not like you start with saying like what's our ROIC going to be in Germany.
I don't know, I've never sold anything in Germany, you know. Like -- like, what's it going to cost to build the brand to have, you know -- have people come, you know, for -- to build up the design book and, you know, the trade book and everything else, you know. So, I -- again, it's -- it's a handful of galleries, right? It's 10 altogether. I think we've got 10 -- nine or 10.
Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer
Ten.
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Ten, yeah. If we do -- yeah, we -- because we do Sydney, and yeah, the two in Madrid and stuff, you know. So, yeah -- so, you know, we're going to get them open, and we're going to start learning. And we're going to, you know, make all kinds of adjustments and get some things right and get some things wrong and work really hard to make it great.
But, you know, I like how we're starting. I mean, like, we look -- you know, you go to Germany, we look really good. I mean the galleries look great, the teams are fantastic, great people are coming in. So, it was really encouraging being in Munich, you know, getting a -- a really a good feel for it.
So, yeah. I mean, obviously, very different than England, you know, and yeah, so -- and we didn't have to spend much capital, you know, in those two galleries. We -- yeah, we took over, you know, a couple of the Abercrombie and Fitch flagships and refitted them and that we didn't have to build them like some of the other ones, you know, or like even in Norwich, England where, you know, we had to rebuild it. So, yeah. So, they're -- you know, they're all going to have different kind of ROIC dynamics to them. But it's really -- it's how's it all blend out, what does it look like, you know, year two year three, you know, as it ramps, once you cycle some of the initial investments to get home delivery up and going and, you know, all the investments we have to make. But the big -- the big -- the real big key, you know, I'd say, it's like -- it's going to be the inflection of the U.S.
business. That's the key, right? That's the big thing to focus on. These things, you know, they're -- they're going to kind of take their own path, and -- and we'll learn and we'll make adjustments. But you know, we're getting these openness. I don't -- I don't mean to minimize it.
I mean it's just -- I think it's kind of unrealistic to have really specific goals for these. You know, we just want to be directionally right and then we'll refine it and -- and, you know, learn and continue to improvise and, you know, and improve everything. But, you know, we're -- we're -- our big focus is to inflect, you know, the -- the U.S. business and, you know, the North American business and, you know, get back to taking market share and, you know, getting our margins back to historical levels.
And we're going to, you know, for part of it, to get to historical levels, you know, and -- and operating margins in the, you know, 20% range, we're going to need the housing market to, you know, unfreeze here and -- and kind of return to a somewhat normal housing market. And that that could take, yeah, another 12 months, you know, I don't know.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict of Baird. Your line is open.
Peter Benedict -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst
Oh, hey, guys. Happy holidays. Yeah, follow-up on that comment there. Just so -- so, I was going to ask you about the conditions you thought were required to -- to get you back to that 20%-ish operating margin.
Clearly, that, you know, an unfreezing of the housing market, I was thinking more, is there a revenue level or scale, you know, business around 3 billion now given, you know, the cost increases across the channel just -- just post-pandemic? Like, what -- is there a revenue level that you think is required to -- to maybe support that? That was kind of my first question.
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, we know that answer. I don't know if we want to say that right now. I mean, you know, like, I think it'll --
Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer
We clearly have some of that higher than today. We've said that the margin, you know, will both gross margin and operating margin will naturally lever as we -- as we -- as we build back the revenue up here. So -- but we're not -- we're not ready to give you that number.
Peter Benedict -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst
OK, got it. Now, fair enough. I mean other question was just around the membership fee. We just noticed you took that up to 200.
Just curious the rationale behind that -- that decision that I think just happened here maybe in the last month or two. So, that's -- that's my second question. Thank you.
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, we just had plans to, you know, bump it up a bit, so...
Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer
It's a natural progression of our business. You know, when we -- we started membership at $100, and for years, we didn't move it, but the AOV of the business had increased, and so, when we first moved it to 150, you know, we talked about that we were kind of -- you know, we might see a more regular cadence of increases. So, I would just say this is just part of that and then reflects the sort of average order value of our business continuing to -- to -- to -- to -- to creep up. And so, its membership as a percentage of that is one way to -- you know, one way you look -- we look at.
Operator
And our last question comes from the line of Brad Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Brad Thomas -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst
Hey, thanks so much. Gary, was hoping we could talk a little bit more about the outlook for gallery. You know, when we look at what you've done in Indianapolis and, you know, what you -- you know, were -- were working on for Miami, really pushing the boundaries here of what's going on in the U.S., I think the letter referenced 20 -- sorry, 40 additional markets you're looking at, I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit more on what you think the U.S. gallery network looks like 10 years from now with this continuing evolution.
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
You know, something like Indianapolis is an opportunistic move, right? An incredible home and estate came on the market. We bought it for 14.5 million, is that what we bought for? Yeah, it's in our joint venture, you know. So, you know, so we -- we, you know, own 50% of it, and you know, it's just an opportunity to get something like that for $14.5 million investment. And you know -- and, you know, what we put into it was, you know, pretty minimal versus what our normal investment was. So, we have this incredible experience for the -- you know, experience for the customers, you know, at a -- at a lower investment rate than we'd make, you know, and a lower occupancy costs than -- than we -- we would expect to have. So, you know, that was just a -- you know, that's kind of a one-off great outcome.
I mean we're always looking for things like that that come up. But I wouldn't say that's, like, you're out looking, you know. You're not really looking for something like that. That just -- they just kind of happen.
So, you know, I think, you know, that's just an opportunistic move. But, you know, what does it look like 10 years from now?
Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer
We have 35 legacy galleries. You know, we'll have, you know, more and more of those converted, will also go back to the existing design galleries. We've talked about certain ones that are going to have the next iteration. Like Houston, for example, will have a big gallery.
Los Angeles, at some point [Inaudible] for example.
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, yeah.
Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer
That -- that, in North America, will continue. And the 40 -- you know, Gary talks about the design markets of the 40 and the -- and the logic there. So, that's -- that's a whole kind of different animal, I guess, in terms of -- in terms of adding to the store base.
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. And we may learn in some of these, you know, smaller kind of what -- you know, what we refer to as a design studio. It's really in -- in Palm Desert, it's like a design office, right? It's really enabling entrepreneurs, you know, the interior designers that maybe don't want to work in a retail gallery and, you know, where there's market opportunities to do something to improve our -- and have a more dominant interior design presence. We think that's really good for the RH brand, you know.
So, some of these will look a lot less like a small store. They'll look a lot more like an interior design office with, you know, a couple of, you know, small presentations to the product but really a real office for an interior designer to -- to work with clients and in a, you know, highly professional way and attract, you know, entrepreneurial people that want to run their own interior design business. And we become a platform that can support them and allow them to do what they really want to do. Yeah, so we may -- you know, for example, like, in the first one that we got in Palm Desert --
Jack Preston -- Chief Financial Officer
But how big is it? Like, 3,000 feet for that?
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, it's like 3,000 feet. We're also looking to probably do a 10,000 to 20,000-square-foot gallery there, probably 15,000 to 25,000, call the range, you know, in that market. And, you know, we'll have both of those locations. Now, one's really a true interior design office, but that gallery that we'll build, you know, probably won't, you know, have the same dedicated space for interior design that we might have in one of our big galleries where we have interior design embedded into the gallery. So, you know, this gives us more flexibility, reach more markets, activate the interior design business, you know, which is a, you know, growing part of what we do.
And I think we're going to learn a lot of these, where there's opportunities for even, you know, bigger stores. It's like if -- if we're -- if we're right on this transformation that -- you know, that we're kind of, you know, have begun here and we're right around about how the business is going to inflect, you know, that's just going to meaningfully take up your volumes on all these markets, makes all the occupancy models look different, right, and allows you to access different things and invest in different ways. So, you know, we're going to -- I'm sure we're going to have an even new -- a new view in the second half of next year. You know, as our -- as our baseline performance improves, you know, it changes your economic outlook from a real estate point of view.
Brad Thomas -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst
OK, great. Thank you, Gary.

There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Gary Friedman, chairman and CEO, for closing remarks.
Gary Friedman -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Great. Well, thank you, everyone. We appreciate your interest. We wish you all a happy holiday.
And I would say to, you know, team RH, we just can't tell you how much we appreciate the energy and -- and the, you know, commitment and passion you bring to our business and to our brand. You know, you -- you are, you know, the heart and soul of this -- of this company. You are the ones that, you know, interface with our consumers every day. And thank you for making us so proud.
And especially to the teams that just brought our international galleries to life, I mean just incredible, you know, what we've done, you know. We've -- we're in Germany but just two weeks ago or 10 days ago and you walk in, you interface with the people, you look at the gallery, you'd think it was in North America. You know, I mean -- and to be, you know, at the very beginning of this and to be executing at that level and to have that quality of people and, you know, that energy in the galleries just gives me and the team here a great deal of confidence of what we can do globally with this brand. So, we wish everyone a wonderful and happy holiday and – and, you know, wish for, you know, peace in the Middle East.
And, you know -- and hopefully, this world becomes a -- a more peaceful place very soon. So, happy holidays, everyone.

Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Beth. It's safe to say, we ended the year on a high note and closed another quarter with record revenues, record booking levels, and record customer deposits. In fact, we consistently set records in all four quarters this past year. We also achieved per diems, EBITDA, and net income for the fourth quarter that all exceeded the high end of our September guidance range, with cruise costs, ex fuel, in line with expectations.
Fourth quarter yields continued on a positive trajectory, significantly higher than a very strong 2019 and even higher than we had anticipated, and enabled us to overcome four years of high cost inflation to deliver per unit EBITDA that eclipsed 2019, holding fuel and currency constant. It was encouraging to see both North American and European brand occupancy levels exceed 101% in the fourth quarter, with per diems for our North American brands up double digits over 2019 and our European brands just shy of a double-digit increase. We delivered per diem improvements of more than 7 points for the full year, with even stronger acceleration in Q4 while closing the double-digit occupancy gap at the start of the year to reach historical levels for the second half of 2023. An absolute spending on board was consistent across all four quarters as we drove improvements in ticket prices.
We delivered 85 million more dollars to the bottom line in the fourth quarter than forecasted, which pushed us through to positive adjusted income for the year. Strong EBITDA and cash from operations also propelled us on our journey to reduce the debt load necessitated during the pause in operations. We've made debt payments of $6 billion this year alone, and we still have well over $5 billion of liquidity on top of strong and improving cash flow, which will contribute to further debt reduction over time. All of this leaves us firmly placed on our path back to achieve investment-grade leverage metrics by 2026.
And most importantly, our brands delivered happiness to over 12 million guests this year, laying the foundation upon which all of our SEA Change targets are built. Turning to bookings. We reached an all-time high in booking volumes for the two weeks around Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and ended the year in the best-booked position we have ever seen on both price and occupancy, setting 2024 off to an amazing start. We now have nearly two-thirds of the business on the books for 2024 and at considerably higher prices.
And during the fourth quarter, we essentially maintained the significant occupancy advantage we had built for 2024 going into the quarter while improving the year-over-year price position of our booked business even further. At this point, much of the first half is already behind us. With approximately 85% of the business on the books, we've essentially closed the double-digit occupancy gap to historical levels on higher capacity and at higher prices. For our peak summer period, all major products are better booked at higher prices, benefiting from an improving trend in both occupancy and price during the fourth quarter.
Our yield management strategy to base load bookings has clearly set us up for another record year. And again, we have seen no signs of our business slowing. The booked position for our North American brands remains as far out as we have ever seen and well ahead of last year at pricing that is considerably higher. Our European brands just delivered record fourth quarter booking volumes at considerably higher prices and with a booking window now fully back to historical norms.
As expected, our European brands are poised to become an even greater contributor to our 2024 operating improvement. At the same time, we are continuing to pull forward onboard revenue through bundling and pre-cruise sales. This strategy, coupled with even more features on board our newer ships for our guests to enjoy, positions us well for further onboard revenue growth next year. All told, we expect occupancy for the full year to return to historical levels on 5% higher capacity while delivering nicely higher per diems, building on this year's record results.
In 2023, we captured over 3.5 million new-to-cruise guests and remain well-positioned to continue to take share from land-based alternatives. In other words, we are gaining momentum in our ability to close the unwarranted value gap to land-based alternatives. And to aid in that effort, we can further champion the fact that while many land-based alternatives have pulled back on service levels, we still deliver incredible service to our guests, thanks to our amazing crew. This pairs exceedingly well with the expansive amount of guest-pleasing amenities offered on board our newer fleet.
In fact, while almost four years have passed since the pause in our operations, our fleet actually came out of the pod a year younger through our fleet optimization efforts. This past year alone, we benefited from three fantastic new ships, including Carnival Celebration and P&O Cruises' Arvia, both of which are flagships for their respective brands, yet leverage our scale as the seventh and eighth vessels in our popular and exceptionally efficient series of XL flagships. And we welcomed Seabourn Pursuit, our second expedition ship. Seabourn has truly raised the bar for expedition cruising in extreme luxury.
And while not technically new, Carnival Cruise Line also welcomed Carnival Venezia into its fun Italian-style platform via the transfer from Costa, and it has been going gangbusters. It's the biggest example yet of how we leverage our scale and will be doubling down when we bring over her sister ship, Carnival Firenze in 2024. Looking forward, this year is set to match the excitement level with the introduction of Carnival Jubilee, a new icon for Carnival Cruise Line and which, no doubt, will be the pride of Texas as she has her inaugural home in Galveston. The innovative Sun Princess, the first of its class and a real game changer for Princess.
And Queen Anne, a new flagship for Cunard and its first new ship in 14 years. With all of these additions, roughly 30% of our capacity will be newly delivered ships. We also made meaningful headway on other strategic asset projects. We began construction on Celebration Key, which will be the largest and closest exclusive destination in our destination portfolio and a real game changer for Carnival Cruise Line.
We'll bring 18 Carnival ships departing from nine home ports to Celebration Key. And while we are still about a year and a half from go live, we are already amping up the awareness and excitement around this fantastic destination. We've also started the process for a significant upsize in guest traffic at Half Moon Cay, our exclusive and beautiful pristine island destination in the Bahamas, with the creation of a pier-side berth that can accommodate even our largest vessels. We've begun work with our Grand Bahama Shipyard partners on the construction of two floating dry docks, one of which will have the largest lifting capacity in the world.
This will result in significant benefit in the future as we reduce travel time, preserve revenue days, and at the same time, reduce our fuel consumption. As you know, we've also been investing more in advertising over the last 18 months, and it has definitely paid off with elevated awareness and consideration for our brands and record booking levels and revenue results. In fiscal 2023, our web visits were up over 35%, our paid search was up roughly 50%, and our natural search was up almost 75%. All many, many multiples of our 5% capacity growth.
In the fourth quarter, we carried more new-to-cruise and more new-to-brand guests than we did in the fourth quarter of 2019. Given our success on generating demand, at this point in time, we plan to maintain a similar level of advertising on a unit basis in 2024 compared to 2023, optimizing around each brand. This will help us continue to build demand and bookings well outside of the current year. We're working aggressively to keep our strong momentum going through wave season and beyond.
Just to list a few examples, Costa recently launched a spectacular new campaign in its core markets, focusing on moments, where guests are left speechless; Holland America launched a sequel to its highly successful Time of Your Life campaign; and AIDA just kicked off its new campaign, Experience Yourself Differently, in conjunction with the holiday season. Carnival will launch a new marketing campaign highlighting Celebration Key in times of waves. P&O Cruises' new campaign, Holiday Like Never Before, launches Christmas Day in the U.K. And Cunard has planned a welcome fit for a queen to introduce Queen Anne early next year, which is sure to capture huge fanfare.
We've been talking about upping our game across the commercial space, and we've made good progress. Of course, we're not done. And as you'd expect, we never will be as there is always room to improve. There's much more to come as we roll out advancements to our yield management tools and lead generation techniques, continue to invest in sales and sales support, and build on already strong relationships with our trade partners.
Turning to costs. As we previously indicated, unit cruise costs, ex fuel, for 2024 are expected to be higher than inflation due to the impact of closing the occupancy gap and the higher volume of dry dock days. David will walk you through in more detail. With that said, we have been working aggressively to mitigate inflation through our cost optimization initiatives, including leveraging our scale.
In some cases, we're investing today for future benefits. Just to cite a couple of examples of initiatives underway, we're essentially complete with the rollout of Starlink across the fleet. This will produce more than a 20% reduction in cost per megabit in 2024 and significantly increase our bandwidth pipeline, resulting in both better guest experience and higher onboard revenues. A clear win-win.
And with our new vendor-neutral platform, we are positioned to quickly capture cost savings in future years. We've also launched our Maritime Asset Strategy Transformation, or what we refer to internally as MAST. MAST is a centralized system developed to optimize the management of equipment and machinery across all brands and all of our ships. MAST will allow us to leverage spare parts more effectively across the entire fleet and optimize our maintenance schedules and practices, all of which will strengthen our efficiency and reduce unplanned maintenance over time.
While we won't see the P&L benefits for MAST this year as we ramp up its implementation in 2024, we expect a multiyear benefit well in excess of $100 million that really begins to ramp up in 2026. All the efforts we're making to drive revenue and manage costs are expected to lead to a 4-point margin improvement in 2024. We're guiding of record EBITDA of over $5.5 billion, which is 30% higher in 2023. Thanks to a strong second half of 2023, we're already tracking ahead of our plan to achieve SEA Change, our three-year financial targets calling for the highest ROIC and EBITDA per ALBD in nearly two decades.
And our 2024 guidance delivers another step change toward these deliverables. EBITDA per berth day is expected to be up by more than 25% over our target starting point, hence more than halfway to the 50% increase expected in our SEA Change targets. Today's guidance would also deliver 9% ROIC, a 4-point increase from the starting point of our target. This leaves just 1.5 point annual increases in 2025 and 2026 to hit our 12% target.
Not surprisingly, our brand dedicated to a single market, Carnival, AIDA, and P&O Cruises in the U.K. are again leading the charge with the highest ROIC levels in the company. And with regard to our greenhouse gas target included in our 2026 SEA Change program, our GHG intensity in 2024 is expected to be just shy of the 20% reduction from 2019 we're targeting. It's worth noting, this was a 2030 goal.
We had already pulled forward by four years. We have been and continue to work aggressively to reduce our environmental footprint and fuel costs at the same time. This deep commitment has not only resulted in industry-leading fuel efficiency, it has also resulted in lower absolute GHG emissions. Our absolute emissions are over 10% lower than the 2011 peak, and that's despite capacity growth of 30% since then.
Last year, we also exceeded our industry-leading shore power capability goal. We are ahead of the curve and now have twice as many ships capable of shore power than there are ports around the world available to plug into. Again, I credit all of these important achievements to our people, ship and shore. Collectively, they continue to outperform, allowing us to make good headway on our SEA Change targets.
We're poised for another step change in operating improvement this year with nearly two-thirds of the business on the books at considerably higher prices, ongoing momentum from improvements across the commercial space, the amazing vacation experiences we deliver day in, day out at way too good of a relative value to land-based alternatives, and an even greater experienced staff, all while growing onboard revenues and managing costs. All of this combined sets us up well to deliver another year of record revenues and record EBITDA. Our cash flow strength, coupled with excess liquidity, the return of credit card reserves in a few weeks, and the lowest order book in decades, will allow us to continue to actively manage down debt and aggressively reduce interest expense over time. It will also propel us on our path to deleveraging, investment-grade credit ratings, and higher ROIC.
I remain confident in our continued execution with an unparalleled portfolio of best-in-class brands, an amazing fleet that just keeps getting better and better, and our greatest assets, our people. This has been a truly remarkable year, and we've come a long way in an incredibly short amount of time. I would like to thank our team members, ship and shore, the best in all of travel and leisure, for delivering unforgettable happiness to over 12 million guests this year by providing them with extraordinary cruise vacations while honoring the integrity of every ocean we sail, place we visit, and life we touch. And thank you for the strong support from our travel agent partners, as well as our loyal guests, destination partners, investors, and our many other stakeholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to David.
David Bernstein -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Josh. I'll start today with a summary of our 2023 fourth quarter and full year results. Next, I will provide a recap of our refinancing and deleveraging efforts during 2023 and finish up with some color on our 2024 full year and first quarter December guidance. Our fourth quarter bottom line exceeded the better end of our guidance range as we outperformed our September guidance.
The $85 million improvement was driven by favorability in revenue from higher ticket prices as net per diems were up over 10%, 3 points better than the midpoint of our September guidance range. In fact, fourth quarter revenues of 5.4 billion were a fourth quarter record, and net yields were up nearly 8% as compared to 2019. A great way to close out the year and another indication that we do not see a slowdown in our consumers. For the full year, thanks to the tremendous efforts of our team members, ship and shore, we closed the books on 2023 with positive adjusted net income.
That is a far cry from our March guidance as we delivered over 550 million more dollars to the bottom line, which was partially offset by a drag from fuel price and currency exchange rates of over $100 million. The improvement was driven by delivering a 7.5% increase in net revenue per diem versus 2019, which was over double the 3.5% midpoint of our March guidance, while closing the double-digit occupancy gap at the start of the year to reach historical occupancy levels. Absolute spending per diems on board were consistent across all four quarters as we drove improvements in ticket prices on both sides of the Atlantic and ended the year with net yields up nearly 1% over 2019. Next, I will provide a recap of our refinancing and deleveraging efforts during 2023.
As Josh indicated, our full year 2023 strong EBITDA of 4.2 billion and strong cash from operations of 4.3 billion propelled us on our journey to pay down debt and reduce the debt burden necessitated by the pause in guest cruise operations. During 2023, we made debt payments of $6 billion and ended the year with just over $30 billion of debt, which is 3 billion better than we forecasted just nine months ago during our March conference call and almost 5 billion of the first quarter peak, transferring enterprise value from debt holders to shareholders. During 2023, we proactively addressed our debt profile as we successfully started our refinancing and deleveraging program. We accelerated our debt repayment efforts and aggressively managed down our interest expense.
In 2023, we effectively stretched out the 2025 maturity on favorable terms by replacing it with a 1.3 billion Term Loan B facility through 2027 and a $500 million offering of senior secured notes through 2029. This refinancing, along with our optimism about our future and the return of customer deposit reserves, gave us the confidence to accelerate our debt repayment by calling 1.2 billion of our highest-cost debt. In addition, we opportunistically prepaid 2.8 billion of additional debt for a total of 4 billion of debt prepayments, including the 1.2 billion of debt cost. Our credit card processes returned to us 800 million of credit card reserves, and we now expect an additional 800 million to be returned this current quarter, representing substantially all of the remaining credit card reserves at year-end.
We took actions in both 2022 and early in 2023 to increase the fixed rate percentage of our debt portfolio to over 80%, up significantly from our 58% fixed levels at the end of 2021, which provided us protection from rising interest rates. Our overall average interest rate is just over 5.5%. All these actions to address our debt profile, alongside our improved business performance, drove 200 million of interest savings compared to our March guidance. Our maturity towers have been well managed through 2026 with just 2.1 billion of debt maturities next year, 2.2 billion in 2025, and 3.2 billion in 2026.
And looking forward, we will continue to evaluate refinancing opportunities and opportunistically prepay additional debt. So, in 2024, we will be replacing higher-cost fixed-rate debt with lower-cost export credit financing as we take delivery of ships during 2024. Our leverage metrics will also continue to improve throughout 2024 as our EBITDA continues to grow. Now, turning to our 2024 full year December guidance.
We are forecasting a capacity increase of about 5.5% compared to 2023. We are expecting to deliver strong 2024 net yield improvement, with our guidance forecasting an increase of approximately 8.5% for the full year 2024 when compared to 2023. And that is on top of our improved 2023 results, where we delivered a 7.5% increase in net revenue per diem versus 2019. The strong improvement in 2024 net yields is a result of the increase in all the component parts: higher ticket prices, higher onboard spending, and higher occupancy, with all three components improving on both sides of the Atlantic.
We are well-positioned to drive 2024 ticket pricing higher with significantly less inventory remaining for sale at the same time last year despite a capacity increase of over 5%. Occupancy for the full year 2024 is on track to return to historical levels. Keep in mind, 2019 was a high watermark for occupancy. For 2024, we forecast to be well within our historical occupancy range as we balance price and volume to optimize total revenues and achieve record yields.
Now, turning to costs. Cruise costs without fuel per available lower berth day, or ALBD, is currently expected to be up approximately 4.5% for 2024 versus 2023. Broadly speaking, there are four main drivers of the cost change. First, our forecast is for decelerating inflation, but nonetheless inflation, with an average 3.5% increase across all our cost categories globally.
Second, with occupancy returning to historical levels, the impact on costs should be 1.5 percentage points to 2 percentage points higher in 2024 as compared to 2023. Third, in 2024, we are expecting 586 dry dock days, an increase of 14% versus 2023, which is expected to impact our overall year-over-year cost comparison by about three-quarters of a point. And fourth, countering these headwinds, we expect these cost increases will be somewhat mitigated by a couple of points given economies of scale from our capacity growth, which is enhanced by taking delivery of larger, more efficient ships, along with various other cost optimization initiatives. Fuel consumption per ALBD is expected to decrease another 4%, and that is on top of the 15.5% reduction achieved from 2019 to 2023.
The net impact of fuel price and currency is expected to favorably impact 2024 by $90 million, with lower fuel prices favorable by 94 million, while the change in currency exchange rates slightly goes the other way. And finally, a few things to note about the outsized increases in the first quarter 2024. The higher net yield guidance for first quarter 2024 of 16.5%, versus the full year 8.5%, is driven by the larger improvement in first quarter occupancy. Let's not forget that we did not reach historical occupancy levels until the second half of 2023, so there is much more occupancy-driven net yield opportunity in the first half.
On the cost side, the higher cruise costs without fuel per available lower berth day guidance for the first quarter of 2024 of 9.5% is driven by four main factors. First, the largest improvement in occupancy will occur in the first quarter. And while it drives greater yield increases in the first quarter, it also drives greater cost increases, which means a total of 3-point to 4-point cost drag in the quarter. Second, while dry dock costs impact our full year guidance, the seasonality of dry dock costs in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior year drives the cost increase of about 1.5 points in this quarter.
Third, the seasonality of advertising expense and a variety of other expenses between the quarters differs in 2024 as compared to 2023, which will put a total cost increase of approximately 3 points into this quarter. Advertising alone is one of the 3 points. And fourth, like the full year inflation mitigated by economies of scale from our capacity growth, along with various other cost optimization initiatives, given the higher first quarter cruise costs without fuel per available lower berth day, the implied guidance for the cost in the second to the fourth quarter is approximately 3%. In summary, putting all these factors together, our net income guidance for the full year 2024 is approximately 1.2 billion, with EBITDA forecasted at 5.6 billion, a significant improvement from 2023.
For those of you who are modeling EPS, let's not forget that when you calculate diluted EPS, you need to add back to 94 million of interest expense related to the company's convertible notes. Our improved financial results and our successful refinancing and deleveraging efforts in 2023, along with our 2024 December guidance, leaves us firmly placed on our path to achieve our 2026 SEA Change goals, moving us further down the road to rebuilding our financial fortress and delivering long-term shareholder value. And now, operator, let's open up the call for questions.
Questions & Answers:

Operator
Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Please proceed.
Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning and happy holidays to all of you. So, Josh or David, you know, if we think about the yield guidance, you know, for the year, just based on the fact that your occupancy should return to, you know, somewhat normal levels, and then pricing has momentum at this point, it seems to be, you know, pretty strong or healthy across the majority of your geographies.
You know, it seems like that plus 8.5% yield guidance might end up being, you know, somewhat conservative when we have this call, you know, a year from now. So, you know, I guess the question is can you give us a little color about the -- you know, more of the makeup of the -- you know, of your yield forecast? And it seems like, you know, you might be taking a somewhat conservative view around onboard trends and then potentially, you know, underestimating the opportunity around, you know, taking close and pricing. Thanks.
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Steve. Happy holidays to you, too. So, I hope you're right. I look forward to the call in a year.
Look, we've given our good faith estimate on how we're seeing the world right now. We come in with a good amount of visibility because of how well-booked we are. And as you said, we have seen accelerating momentum in the volume and the price. So, we're very pleased with the trajectory that we've been seeing.
Obviously, this is also before wave, and we do have a little bit of a disadvantage of doing this in December versus, you know, end of January, into February. So, you know, all I can tell you is we've baked in what we see, and we always want to outperform. I mean, obviously, that's a given. So, I think the best thing I can tell you is we'll talk in March with wave under our belt.
Having said that, you know, wave hasn't ended since last year, so we'll continue to ride it as long as we can.
Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Let me ask that in a different way then, Josh. So, if we think about what you guys are embedding in terms of onboard, you know, is it fair to assume you are being pretty conservative with the way onboard should shake out in '24? Basically, meaning, you know, you potentially could see, you know, a little bit of a slowdown in onboard or, you know, are you still, guys, kind of assuming that onboard remains as robust as it has been?
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
You know, we're coming off a great performance when it comes to onboard, and we expect our onboard per diems to be increasing in 2024 versus 2023. You know, brands are doing a really good job of pulling forward more spend, providing differentiated experiences, so we absolutely expect an increase in '24 versus '23.
Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
OK. Gotcha. Then real quick, one more question if I could. David, in terms of the cost, you gave some pretty good color around, you know, the impact to the -- you know, everything that's going into the first quarter and why it's so high.
You know, as we think about the rest of the year, the cadence of costs, I think you said, if we think about the third -- the second quarter through the fourth quarter, those should all be, you know, around 3%. I just want to make sure I heard that right. And if there is anything, you know, in 2Q through 4Q that we should be thinking about that might, you know, move one of those quarters one way or the other?
David Bernstein -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. No. So, I was not trying to give individual guidance for each quarter. What I was trying to do is say that the three quarters collectively together would average 3%.
We will see some, you know, year-over-year differences versus 2023. A great example of that is that the dry dock days will be down in second quarter, but they'll be up in fourth. So, there will be differences. There's also advertising seasonalization differences and other things.
So, I was not trying to say 3% every quarter, just 3% on average for the three.
Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
OK. That is great. Thank you very much, guys. Happy holidays.
Appreciate it and great quarter.
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
Thank you very much. Take care, Steve.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Please proceed.
Brandt Montour -- Barclays -- Analyst
Great. Thanks, everyone, and congratulations on the results this morning. So, Josh, you gave us an update on the SEA Change long-term targets and the drastic improvement toward that target and -- that you've made so far in '23 and then '24 expected. And I guess, you know, fuel has been a nice tailwind.
If you take fuel out and maybe just focus on your yield growth target within '24 guidance, is that in line with your internal expectations for that three-year ramp, or how do you think about it?
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think it's fair to say that, you know, when we talked about it in June for the first time and we laid out, you know, what will it take, we talked about the fact that, excuse me, getting back to, excuse me, historical occupancy, we expect pretty much all of that in '24 versus 20 -- where we were in '23. And that's -- you know, as far as we can tell, that's exactly how it's going to play out. And on top of that, we predict pricing -- we estimate pricing to be up low to mid-single digits every year: '24, '25, '26.
And so, you know, we feel like we are -- we entered the year a little bit ahead given how we ended the second half of 2023, and we'll keep pushing forward.
Brandt Montour -- Barclays -- Analyst
OK. Great. Thanks for that. And then you said you were two-thirds booked for '24.
That struck me as incredibly impressive. I mean, if you can give us a sense of what that would have been in prior years? But also, the crux of the question is, did that base loading strategy, do you think that impacted your pricing meaningfully versus what it would have been if you had just kept this sort of historical booking curve? And then as you go into January and wave season, you know, you've never been this booked, so has that changed your strategy with pricing as you move through wave?
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
So, this is playing out as we would expect it to play out. By pulling forward all the volume, it gives us better control over our pricing environment and our ability to keep pricing at an elevated level. And so, it's literally playing out as it should. This is -- we are 10 points higher than we were, you know, when we entered the Q1 of '24, 10 points higher year over year.
It's higher than 2019 as well. But --
Unknown speaker
With a very long booking window.
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
Which is a very long normalized booking window. And it's important that we do that, right? I mean, let's keep in mind, you know, being 10 points above last year is good progress, but we expect to end our occupancy significantly higher than last year. So, that's all feeding into the strategy, and pricing is playing along. As I tried to say in my notes, I'm not sure how clear it was, you know, when we entered the fourth quarter of this year, we were about 10 points higher than prior year in the occupancy position and prices were higher.
As we've made our way through the quarter, we've managed to pretty much keep that occupancy advantage, and prices on everything that's booked is now considerably higher. So, it is working the way we anticipated.
Brandt Montour -- Barclays -- Analyst
Crystal clear. Thanks, everyone.
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
Excellent. Thanks, Brandt.
Operator
Our next question comes from James Hardiman with Citi. Please proceed.
James Hardiman -- Citi -- Analyst
Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, I'm going to ask I think Steve's question in a slightly different way.
There was a lot of conjecture that you would only give first quarter guidance, similar to last year. Obviously, your peers are at a bit of an advantage because they get that first month of wave as they try to assess what the demand environment looks like. Obviously, you gave us the full year guide anyway. As we interpret that guide then, you know, take us through that thought process and whether or not that plays into sort of your level of conservatism being effectively ahead of wave.
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
You know, well, we're -- we are, you know, effectively back to normal. This is what we used to do before the last few years, and I think it was quite important that we get back into this cadence. Now, good news, we are the highest booked we've ever been, so we do have more visibility than even we had before 2020. So, I think that's setting us up well to be able to be in a pretty good position to give you this preliminary guidance for 2024.
Obviously, we have -- I have high expectations in my brands and what I expect them to achieve, including during wave. And you got to remember, the whole focus of wave this year, we have the benefit of being able to focus on different things. Last year in wave, a lot of what we were trying to accomplish and our brands were trying to accomplish was just filling the ships because we were in such a different position from an occupancy perspective. This time, we actually get to go through wave and really be more strategic in how we are trying to advance the needle, not just on the short term, but on the longer term.
So, I think it sets us up well. And I keep asking David to change the fiscal year-end and like can we please start on January 1st like everybody else? But apparently, that's a lot of work, so we're not going to do that.
James Hardiman -- Citi -- Analyst
Got it. And then there was a comment in the prepared remarks about not only are you seeing better new-to-cruise numbers, but better new-to-brand numbers relative to 2019. Josh, you talked about having confidence in your brands, but that latter point seems like a big one, right? So much of the conversation just seems to be about the cruise industry, but maybe talk to what you think might be a Carnival-specific story as -- in terms of improving consideration among people that are already into cruising?
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think our brands are doing phenomenally in really understanding who that target audience is and how to speak to them with their creative marketing. And then on the performance side, just making sure that that consideration and awareness gets converted into bookings. So, you know, we gave a -- you know, I said in my prepared remarks, we've got several campaigns that are either started or about to start, and we've got a few examples.
You can click through on the prepared materials, the slides that have been put up. They're doing a great job at captivating the market and I think getting cut through not just with new-to-brand and new-to-cruise on the value that we have. And it's -- unfortunately for us, as much as we've improved on the pricing front in 2023, it's still a big gap versus land. So, all of those things are wind at our backs, and I expect more of that over time.
James Hardiman -- Citi -- Analyst
Got it. Thanks, guys, and good luck during wave.
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please proceed.
Jaime Katz -- Morningstar -- Analyst
Good morning. Thank you. I'm hoping you can talk a little bit about changes to the sourcing strategy. I know it shifted back a little bit more to North American cruisers in the last couple of years.
But given the strength in the European market or the fact that they might be closing the gap, should we expect that to move back to a normal mix?
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, good morning, Jaime. So, I think we should, you know, kind of take a step back and think about our portfolio and how we operate. You know, we've got dedicated brands to European markets, you know, with P&O Cruises in the U.K. and AIDA in Germany, Costa, not just for Italy, but really Italy, Spain, and France.
And all of those are either the biggest in their market or the second biggest, in the case of Costa, across the Mediterranean. And we didn't deviate from our strategy when it comes to our dedicated market brands. And so, they have continued to view those markets as the right thing to be in the long term, and we absolutely support that. And we're starting to see the strength of that really come through as we've started talking about the last few quarters.
With respect to our North American brands, you know, Carnival has been and will continue to be America's cruise line, and they're knocking the cover off the ball. And there hasn't been that much dramatic change when it comes to sourcing for Holland America and Princess other than the fact that for Princess, they had so much sourcing that was really geared toward markets that have been slow to open in Asia, etc. So, we've repositioned. We've done a bit of that.
But I think we are very well-positioned to take the strength of the European consumer and the U.K. consumer and continue to ride that into 2024.

Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with Truist. Please proceed.
Patrick Scholes -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
Hey. Good morning, everyone.
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Patrick.
Patrick Scholes -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
Good morning. Josh, I am not going to ask you if you are planning on hedging fuel this time, but I do have another question. Yeah.
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Patrick.
Patrick Scholes -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
Sometimes you should listen to us, sometimes not, but here we are. I want to hear from you, you know, what trends of late, you know, especially around Black Friday, Cyber Monday, you've seen with new-to-cruise. You know, is that becoming a larger part of the booking mix? And, you know, if so, you know, what would be the impact on your margins? I imagine new-to-cruise typically, you know, calls the 800 number, books direct, which probably saves you travel agency commissions. You know, just talk about those trends and the potential impact on, you know, revenues and costs.
Thank you.
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
Thank you. So, candidly, I don't have -- literally for the period that you're referencing, the Cyber Monday and Black Friday, I don't have a breakdown of new-to-cruise versus new-to-brand versus brand loyalists. I do have the fourth quarter, obviously, which includes some of that, where our new-to-cruise is obviously up significantly year over year, 51%. And so, you know, that is part of the strategy, right, taking -- oh that was sale, pardon me.
I'm sorry, that was sale. But taking a greater share of folks who have never cruised before is part of the strategy to increase overall demand, get them in our pipeline and allow us to raise pricing over time for, frankly, everybody. With respect to what's the most cost-efficient, obviously, coming direct on the web is always going to be the most cost-effective. I wouldn't make a categorization, though, that new-to-cruise comes in a particular way because it really depends on the characteristic of the new-to-cruise guests themselves, what brand it is, what's the itinerary length, you know, etc.
Now, clearly, a lot of new-to-cruise will over-index on the shorter cruises because they're trying it out for the first time, and that lends itself to maybe also a younger crowd, which is more comfortable, just playing around on the net and doing things direct. But I mean, frankly speaking, historically, and I expect this to continue, our trade partners are absolutely critical in driving new-to-cruise to us, and we've relied on them for decades to do that, and we will rely on them for decades more. And they have done a great job of really catching up to where we've been in the curve, and year over year, they're showing great strength as well.
Patrick Scholes -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
OK. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Please proceed.
Robin Farley -- UBS -- Analyst
Great. Thank you. I wanted to circle back to your yield guidance, and just looking at the recovery in occupancy to previous levels being, you know, maybe 600 basis points to 700 basis points kind of implies that your per diem guidance is maybe less than 2% growth. So, I just -- I don't know if I'm doing the math wrong there.
If there's anything to clarify. And then also, you've talked about the price on the books for next year are being considerably higher, but your yield guidance for the year, it's just nicely higher, which I think in the David Bernstein glossary is like a -- would be a deceleration in yield. So, I'm just wondering --
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
I'm laughing at the glossary. Yeah, keep going, Robin.
Robin Farley -- UBS -- Analyst
Well, if I remember -- if I'm interpreting the glossary correctly, I think that implies a sort of a deceleration in the price there. So, just -- is that just because the onboard growth rate while up is lower and so that brings like considerably a higher price to just nicely higher yield, or maybe my glossary definition is wrong, but maybe you could help us with that and with the math on the per diem to begin with. Thanks.
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
Hey. Thanks, Robin. Well, actually, you know, David said it in the prepared remarks. I thought he said it pretty well.
So, David, do you want to repeat what you said?
David Bernstein -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, you know, keep in mind that 2019 was the high watermark for occupancy. And we look back to like 2005 and the historical occupancy levels were in the range of 104% to 107%. So, what we're saying is we will be solidly back to historical occupancy levels, but we weren't saying we're going to be back to the high watermark of 2019.
So, keep that in mind. The other thing about the considerably higher versus the nicely higher, keep in mind that, you know, last March when we gave guidance, you know, we had thought that -- our expectation for per diem increases was about 3.5%. And we wound up up 7.5%. So, we saw some very strong pricing in the back half of the year.
And as a result of that, on a year-over-year comparison basis, you know, our book position may be considerably higher, but what we're looking to see is at least nicely higher pricing on a per diem basis built into our guidance. So, when you put those two factors together, hopefully, you can understand how we built our guidance.
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. And the only thing I'd add -- let me just add one thing, Robin, which is our focus is on generating the most revenue possible when that ship leaves on its cruise, and that's going to be a combination of optimizing that price and occupancy relationship. So, there's no magic to getting back to 2019 high watermark of 107%. And we play in the fringes.
We play in that 104% to 107% to make sure that when you combine that ending point along with the pricing, it's the happiest we can be.
Robin Farley -- UBS -- Analyst
Understood that occupancy right, that you don't manage to a certain occupancy once you're in that range. But just the -- that the price comment that you're -- what you're saying on the books being considerably up versus the nicely up does seem to imply like that you would be expecting a deceleration from current levels. And so, I mean, maybe the answer is you're just being conservative, but I just -- if that's correct in interpreting considerably moving to nicely as being a lower rate of growth, that's -- I guess that's what I was trying to clarify.
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
So, one thing to stress, right, we just came off of the fourth quarter, which everybody is glossing over real quick, but it was up 10.5 points in price. That's what we're going to lap, you know, when we get through 2024. If you think about our booked business, we have the most to go in the fourth quarter, not surprisingly, it's the farthest out. So, as we build toward that and we cycle through the first quarter and the second quarter where we're the most booked, we just have to fill and get over a larger hurdle, which we expect to do.
But we have to take that whole thing into the equation when we're giving full year guidance.
Robin Farley -- UBS -- Analyst
Oh, that makes perfect sense. Thank you. Thank you. And then just one last clarification.
On your SEA Change on the expense side, you've talked about the three-year being up low single digit in like '24, '25, '26 each year. This year, up for -- or '23 and '24 guidance up 4.5%. You know, probably above low single digit kind of implies very, very low expense growth in '25 and '26. Is that how we should think about? In other words, there's not a change in your -- the three-year average would be up low single digit, even though it's up a bit more in '24 than that would suggest.
And again, possibly, you're just being conservative, but I don't know if you had a thought on how we should think about how much better that would be in 20 -- would have to be in '25 and '26 to keep your SEA Change expense target? Thank you.
David Bernstein -- Chief Financial Officer
Sure. So, you know, when we were presenting our SEA Change program, I guess it was, you know, in June, we were talking about the fact that low single digits, but I did say we'd have some outsized impacts in 2024 due to occupancy, both on the yield and on the cost. So, the 4.5%, I also had indicated that occupancy would probably cost 1.5 points to 2 points this year. So, we are, you know, in that low single digits equation that was built into the model.
So, I feel like we are very well-positioned. And as Josh indicated, we're ahead of where we expected to be on our way toward achieving those targets.
Robin Farley -- UBS -- Analyst
Thank you.
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
I would say, Robin, I didn't think we'd get through the call without you trying to get ahead of '24 guidance and looking at '25.
Robin Farley -- UBS -- Analyst
Well, I almost didn't get in the last five minutes of the call. I'm glad I got it in. So, thank you.
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
There you go. No problem.

Our next question comes from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Dan Politzer -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Hey. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions. I just actually wanted to touch on the fourth quarter a little bit more. You know, the uptick in revenues on pricing certainly was impressive.
Can you maybe unpack that a little bit more? I mean, was that really just, you know, the Carnival-centric line or was it Europe or, you know, North America more broadly or was this, you know, alternatively related to your strategy of more base loading and maybe benefiting from some of the compression we've seen?
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
This was portfoliowide, so we're very pleased with where we headed into the fourth quarter. Dave, I don't know if you want to give any color.
David Bernstein -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. No, I mean, you're right, it was all brands, and we saw strength in bookings, and, you know, our brands did a great job yield managing the revenue and taking price up. And so, as a result of that, you saw the end result.
Dan Politzer -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Got it. Then Grand Bahama, I know you've started to talk a little bit more about that. Are there any parameters you can give us there in terms of capacity per day, amenities, you know, the capex or return profile you're looking at? And also, I know you've started to see some booking activity that's going there. Are you receiving, you know, premiums on those bookings? I think you mentioned like hundreds of sailings in the release.
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Well, let me start with that. We have -- it's tiny in the grand scheme of things still. I mean, because you're talking about Carnival Cruise Line, which, you know, doesn't -- has a lot of short programs, etc.
that don't really start booking. So, it's a tiny amount now. We'll give color as we get through 2024 in that respect, so we'll come back to that. With respect to your other points, you know, we've said this is a big investment.
This is a $0.5 billion type of investment, you know, and we can do that. Obviously, in 2025, we only have one ship, and we have none in 2026. So, we think this is a right way to optimize our resources and really benefit the Carnival brand. And you've heard us say, 18 ships from day one.
So, we are very, very excited about that. I don't want to get ahead. I really want to do a good job of disciplining myself to not get ahead of Christine Duffy, who really wants to and should talk about what this experience is going to be like, and more to come in 2024. And I can't wait for you to listen to Christine and hear all about it.
Dan Politzer -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Got it. And then just if I could squeeze in one quick housekeeping. Panorama, that was, I think, out of service a little bit in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter. Is there any way to just quantify the impact of that?
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
You know, in the grand scheme of things, it's probably a couple of pennies.
David Bernstein -- Chief Financial Officer
Between like maybe one penny in the fourth quarter and a couple in the first.
Dan Politzer -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Got it. Thanks so much and happy holidays.
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
Thanks. Frank, we have time for one last question.
Operator
We have a question from Assia Georgieva with Infinity Research. Please proceed.
Assia Georgieva -- Infinity Research -- Analyst
Got to be the lucky one. Congratulations, guys, on a great Q4. So, happy that we're back to looking at deals as opposed to per diems, and 10.5% was a great metric, but the 7.8%, I like better. So, I apologize, but again, I wanted us to finally get back to where we're looking at the more usual metrics.
Given that we have a very healthy outlook in terms of yields in Q1 and Q2, dry docks, I think, I at least understand well. So, we have a good view into EBITDA throughout the year. David, would you mind taking us through sort of the debt and interest expense burdens that you may be trying to modify, including as part of the SEA Change program, by fiscal year-end 2024?
David Bernstein -- Chief Financial Officer
Sure. So, to start with, you know, you saw our interest expense guidance in the press release. It was a -- close to $100 million less than 2023. And keep in mind that while we did pay down, you know, quite a bit of debt, the average balance for the year is -- for 2024 is probably like 2.5 billion less than 2023, so that will lower interest expense by 200 million.
But also, keep in mind that we have less cash on the books. And with declining interest income rates, that probably is offsetting the savings by about 100 million. So, that's why it's a net decline of about 100 million in interest expense on a year-over-year basis. Looking at the debt level, I actually said this in my notes, you know, in 2024, we are looking at about two point -- I think it's 2.1 billion of scheduled maturities, but we will be replacing that debt with the 2.3 billion of export credits that we take on.
So -- but in addition to that, we have built in some prepayments of debt into our guidance. And as I said, we are evaluating that. So, we do expect to see debt to go down in 2024. However, we do expect to see strong deleveraging from a metrics perspective because our EBITDA grows substantially, so our debt to EBITDA will also improve.
Assia Georgieva -- Infinity Research -- Analyst
Makes perfect sense. And just as a quick follow-up before I ask my second question, if I may, would we be looking at refinancing as opposed to repayment?
David Bernstein -- Chief Financial Officer
So, we are looking at both. You know, as far as -- we expect to continue to prepay debt and to continue the deleveraging. But on top of that, we also expect to look at some potential refinancing, which really would drive the interest costs down. And so, we'll see how -- what opportunities present -- are presented to us in 2024.
And if it makes sense, we'll take advantage of them.
Assia Georgieva -- Infinity Research -- Analyst
This sounds great. And so, if I can ask my second question, and I don't think anyone has touched on this. Given geopolitical pressures and we're comparing -- used to be comparing 2023 to 2019 when we had Saint Petersburg, which, clearly, the Eastern Baltics have been kind of off the books. Now, we have an issue with the Middle East, and Costa Toscana, I believe, is in the Persian Gulf, but will be one of the ships that will have to come back to Europe and going through, you know, a strait that is -- have been targeted by Yemeni military cells.
Any thoughts on this --
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah.
Assia Georgieva -- Infinity Research -- Analyst
Or --
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
Obviously, we -- you know, our first priority is going to be safety, and we have -- we -- that's already on our radar screen, and we've got mitigation plans should we need it. But keep in mind, this is months away. And so, we will -- we'll do the right thing, but there's always something. You know, I hate to say it that way, but there is always something.
And our brands --
Assia Georgieva -- Infinity Research -- Analyst
I've been around long enough, you know, 26 years. So, there is always something, Josh. I agree.
Josh Weinstein -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So -- all right. I think with that, we do have to end it, but I'd say happy holidays to everybody and thank you very much. Have a good new year.

That is a far cry from our March guidance as we delivered over 550 million more dollars to the bottom line, which was partially offset by a drag from fuel price and currency exchange rates of over $100 million. The improvement was driven by delivering a 7.5% increase in net revenue per diem versus 2019, which was over double the 3.5% midpoint of our March guidance, while closing the double-digit occupancy gap at the start of the year to reach historical occupancy levels.""",What is Carnival Corporation's plan to continue driving demand and bookings beyond wave season?,"According to Josh Weinstein, Chief Executive Officer, Carnival Corporation is working aggressively to keep their strong momentum going through wave season and beyond.

Operator
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Zumiez Inc. fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings conference call. At this time all, participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session toward the end of this conference.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone of the company's safe harbor language. Today's conference call includes comments concerning Zumiez's Inc. business outlook and contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements and all other statements that may be made on this call that are not based on historical facts are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Actual results may differ materially. Additional information concerning a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the information that will be discussed is available in Zumiez's filings with the SEC. At this time, I will turn the call over to Rick Brooks, chief executive officer. Mr.
Brooks?
Rick Brooks -- Chief Executive Officer
Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. With me today is Chris Work, our chief financial officer. I'll begin with a few remarks about our fourth-quarter and full-year performance before discussing some of our strategic priorities for 2024. Chris will then take you through the financials and our outlook for the coming year. After that, we'll open the call to your questions.
The fourth quarter represented an encouraging finish to what was a challenging year. As was the case throughout fiscal 2023, we faced headwinds in the fourth quarter, including highly promotional activity across the soft lines retail sector and an increasingly selective consumer pressured by the multiyear inflationary impact on discretionary income. That said, our men's business turned positive in November and growth accelerated in both December and January. Overall momentum built throughout the quarter with total sales trends improving month to month, culminating in January turning to positive comparable sales, fueling fourth-quarter sales and adjusted EPS that were both above the high end of our guidance ranges. In many ways, in the fourth quarter, monthly sales trends were a microcosm of the trend we've seen throughout the year. To recap our improving trend line, year-over-year total sales were down 70% in first quarter, down 12% in the second quarter, down 9% in the third quarter, and down less than 4% in the fourth quarter excluding the benefit of the 53rd week, which drove sales slightly positive for the quarter.

As we enter 2024, we have continued to see some areas of strength in our business. While total sales trends for February were not yet positive, we did see sequential strength as we move through the month and noted that the primary headwind was tied to seasonal snow sales in Europe that turned negative in February after being significantly positive in January due to the timing of promotions. From October through February, Europe's snow sales were down low single digits despite significant variability across periods that pushed our seasonal snow comparable sales positive in January and negative in February. To be clear, 2023 was a disappointing year overall, and we're not satisfied with our results.
With two years of meaningful negative comparable sales trends, the business has deleveraged significantly, and we experienced the first annual net loss in our history this last year. As we look to 2024, we expect the macro climate to remain a headwind in the near term, as Chris will detail in our outlook, however, we are optimistic that the work we're doing will inflect our trend line positive. Overall, we will focus on items within our control to grow sales and drive the business back to profitability. To that end, we plan to take specific actions to adjust portions of our strategy in the new year. I'll quickly take you through the most significant changes starting with a shift in focus for the European business. The last few years have been particularly challenging for profitability in the European market.
The business is close to achieving breakeven in 2019 before the onset of the pandemic. However, the longer and stricter pandemic area closures in Europe, combined with the inflationary impact to the consumer and instability in the region in the year since, have resulted in earnings declines for our European business since 2020. To correct this negative trend, we're pivoting our focus away from store expansion to enhancing the productivity of the existing European business. With the solid foundation of nearly 90 stores across nine countries and a pan-European web business, we believe we have adequate penetration today in the relevant European markets to unlock the potential for the concept and to create value as we work through what has been a difficult cycle.
By focusing on increasing the productivity of our current business in Europe will improve our near-term profitability and cash flow while also creating a profitable platform for long-term growth in the future. We have seen positive signs such as double-digit comparable sales growth in Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden during the year, which gives us confidence that we can achieve profitability in Europe as we've done in other international markets like Canada and Australia. There's no doubt that trends emerge locally and grow globally. We remain relevant in these markets as a significant advantage to Zumiez over the long term and serving both our customers and our brand partners. This heightened emphasis on profitability extends beyond Europe.
In 2023, we closed 20 underperforming North American stores and expect to close an additional 20 to 25 locations in 2024 should results continue to be challenged. As a result, we have reduced field and corporate staffing levels to align with reduced store count. We also further optimizing store labor through several initiatives including adjustments to staffing models at lower-volume stores. We have made structural changes to reducing shipping and logistics costs companywide and continue to implement other cost savings opportunities in many areas throughout the organization. While we heighten our focus on profitability companywide, we're also making investments to ensure we continue to win with customers including injecting assortments with newness. In 2023, we launched nearly 200 new brands, almost double a typical year, and we expect this newness with relevant and desired brands to continue to attract a broader customer set into 2024 and beyond. We're already seeing our new brands launched in the last couple of years represent a larger portion of our sales than we've historically seen, which we believe is an indication that they're resonating with our customers.
We're also growing our private-label brands. Private label represented approximately 23% of sales in 2023, compared to 18% in 2022 and 13% in 2021, which is a testament to our teams in capturing both the trend and value customer and provides another significant runway for growth. And we're maintaining our best-in-class service in stores and on the web with continued investment in training and technology that, combined, are aimed at enhancing our relationship with customers and connecting with them in a more personalized and relevant way. After two challenging years, we're ending 2024 with a strong balance sheet and over $170 million in cash that -- that will allow us to weather the current environment. Before I call -- before I close the call and turn the call over to Chris, I'd like to thank our teams and our brand partners for their efforts and partnerships in 2023. Our talented and dedicated people have been a bright spot while we've navigated recent challenges, and will be the driving force behind the company's return to sustainable growth in the quarters and years ahead. I remain confident in our ability to serve our customers and drive back to profitability and positive cash flow and look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters ahead.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris to discuss the financials.
Chris Work -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to start with a review of the fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 results. I'll then provide an update on our first quarter-to-date sales trends before providing some perspective on the full year. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2023, which was a 14-week period, increased 0.6% to $281.8 million, compared to $280.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, which was a 13-week period. Comparable sales were down 3.9%.
The decrease in comparable sales was driven by continued inflationary pressure on the consumer, continued challenges and competition for the discretionary dollar, and tougher trends in certain categories of our business. From a regional perspective, comparing the 14-week period in the current year to the 13-week period in the prior year, North America net sales were $212.4 million, a decrease of 3.4% from 2022. Other international net sales, which consist of Europe and Australia, were $69.4 million, up 15.2% from last year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, North American net sales decreased 3.4% and other international net sales increased 12.3% compared with 2022.
Comparable sales for North America were down 5.4%, and comparable sales for our other international were up 0.9% for the 14 weeks ended February 3rd, 2024. From a category perspective, men's was the only category with positive comparable sales for the quarter, while all other categories were down from the prior year. Women's was our most negative category followed by accessories, hard goods, and footwear. The decrease in comparable sales was driven by a decrease in transactions, partially offset by an increase in dollars per transaction. Dollars per transaction were up for the quarter driven by an increase in units per transaction and an increase in average unit retail. Fourth-quarter gross profit was $96.7 million, compared to $95.3 million in the fourth quarter of last year.
Gross profit was 34.3% of sales for the quarter, compared with 34% in the fourth quarter of 2022. The 30-basis-point increase in gross margin was primarily driven by 70 basis points of benefit in shipping costs related to better outbound shipping rates, 60 basis points positive impact related to a mix shift away from service and related shipping revenue in the prior year, results which carried a negative margin during the prior year quarter and 30 basis points of leverage in store occupancy costs related to a reduction in total expense year over year combined with the modest increase in sales related to the 53rd week. These benefits were offset by 110-basis-point reduction in product margin due to discounted selling to manage agent inventory, which was generally in line with our expectations, and a 20 basis points of deleverage in fixed and other costs included in gross margin. SG&A expense for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $129.4 million, or 45.9% of net sales for fiscal 2023, compared with $80.1 million, or 28.6% of net sales in 2022. This includes a $41.1 million noncash goodwill impairment charge that resulted from our decision to slow growth in Europe and focus on profitability. This change in our modeling had a direct impact on the future cash flow projections of our Blue Tomato business that have been tied to increased store growth and improved performance as we grow the business.
The 1,730-basis-point increase in SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales was driven by the following: 1,440-basis-point increase driven by the impairment of goodwill in Europe, 140-basis-point increase related to store wages deleveraging on the decrease in comparable sales as well as wage rate increases; 70-basis-point increase in nonwage store operating costs; 50-basis-point increase in other corporate costs; and 30-basis-point increase in nonstore wages. Operating loss in the fourth quarter inclusive of the 41.1 million goodwill impairment charge was $32.8 million, or 11.6% of net sales, compared with operating profit of $15.2 million, or 5.4% of net sales last year. Net loss for the fourth quarter was $33.5 million, or $1.73 per share. This includes the goodwill impairment charge which, on an after-tax basis, was $41.1 million, or $2.13 per share. In the year-ago period, we reported net income of $11.4 million, or $0.59 per diluted share.
We had tax expense in the current quarter despite our pre-tax operating loss due to the distribution of pre-tax income across our different tax jurisdictions. This compares to an effective tax rate of 29.2% in the fourth quarter last year. Looking at our full-year results, net sales for the 53 weeks of fiscal 2023 were $875.5 million, a decrease of 8.6% from $958.4 million in 2022. Comparable sales for the full year were down 10.6%. The decrease in comparable sales was related to continued inflationary pressures on the consumer, continued challenges and competition for the discretionary dollar, and tougher trends in certain categories of our business. From a regional perspective, North America net sales were $697.6 million, a decrease of 13.1% from 2022.
Other international net sales were $177.9 million, up 14% from last year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, North American net sales decreased 12.9%, and other international net sales increased 11.8% compared with 2022. Comparable sales for North America were down 13.5%, and comparable sales for other international were up 3.4% for the 53-week year ended February 3rd, 2024. From a category perspective, all categories were down from the prior year in comparable sales. Footwear was our most negative category followed by women's, accessories, hard goods, and men's.
The decrease in net sales included a decrease in transactions, partially offset by an increase in dollars per transaction. The increase in dollars per transaction was driven by an increase in average unit retail, partially offset by a decrease in units per transaction. 2023 gross margin was 32.1, compared with 33.9% in 2022. The 180-basis-point decrease was driven by deleverage in our fixed costs as well as rate increases in several areas. The key areas driving the decline were 130 basis points of deleverage in store occupancy costs and a 70-basis-point decline in product margin. These decreases were partially offset by a 20 basis points of efficiencies in distribution costs.
SG&A expense was $345.7 million, or 39.5% of net sales for fiscal 2023, compared with $293.6 million, or 30.7% net sales in 2022. This includes the $41.1 million of goodwill impairment mentioned in our quarterly update. The 180-basis-point increase as a percentage of net sales was driven by 470 basis points due to the noncash goodwill impairment; 180 basis points increase related to store wages, deleveraging on the decrease in comparable sales as well as wage rate increases; 110 basis point increase in nonwage-related store operating costs and 80 basis points in nonwage -related corporate costs; and 60 basis points in non-store wage costs which includes a benefit in the prior year of 40 basis points related to a 3.6 million European government stimulus payment. These increases were partially offset by a 20-basis-point decrease in training and events. Operating loss in 2023 was $64.8 million, or 7.4% of net sales, inclusive of the 41.1 million goodwill impairment charge, compared with operating income of $31.1 million, or 3.2% of net sales last year. Full-year net loss was $62.6 million, or $3.25 per share including the noncash goodwill impairment charge booked in the fourth quarter of 2023 worth $41.1 million, or $2.13 per share. This is compared to net income of $21 million, or $1.08 per diluted share in 2022.
Turning to the balance sheet. The business ended the year in a strong financial position. We had cash and current marketable securities of $171.6 million as of February 3rd, 2024, compared to $173.5 million as of January 28th, 2023. The slight decrease in cash and current marketable securities over the last year was driven primarily by capital expenditures of $20.4 million, partially offset by cash flow from operations of $14.8 million.
As of February 3rd, 2024, we have no debt on the balance sheet and continue to maintain our full unused credit facility. We ended the year with $128.8 million in inventory, down 4.4%, compared with $134.8 million last year. On a constant-currency basis, our inventory levels were down 4.1% from the last year with decreases in both our North America and European businesses. Given the sales backdrop, we are happy with our ending inventory balance for 2023 and expect to continue to bring newness in as we move through 2024. Looking forward to 2024, it is important to remind everyone that 2023 was a 53-week year while 2024 is a 52-week year. With the calendar shift, we expect sales and profit movement between quarters across 2024 are creating comparability challenges year over year in our commentary.
As such, we will provide actual comparable sales to like periods as we move through the year, which will represent a better measure of current performance. Additionally, with the closures in 2023 and anticipated closures in 2024, we expect our store count will be down year over year on a quarter-to-quarter basis, which will negatively impact total sales growth while having more muted impact on earnings due to the performance of those closures. Now, to our first quarter-to-date results. Total net sales for the four-week fiscal period ended March 2nd, 2024 ended three -- decreased 3.1% compared to the four-week fiscal period ended February 25th, 2023. Our comparable sales decreased 6.2% during the four-week period ended March 2nd, 2024 from the comparable weeks in the prior year. Fom a regional perspective, North American net sales for the four-week period ended March 2nd, 2024 increased 2% over the four-week period ended February 25th, 2023, while our other international business decreased 18.6%.
Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, North American net sales increased 2.1% and other international sales decreased 18.5% compared with 2023. Comparable sales for North America decreased 2.6 for the four-week period ended March 2nd, 2024 compared to the same weeks in the prior year, while comparable sales for our other international business declined 17.8%. From a category perspective, the men's category was our largest positive comparable sales growth category followed by footwear. The hard goods category was our largest decline in comparable sales, followed by accessories and women's.
The comparable sales decrease was driven by a decrease in transaction, partially offset by an increase in dollars per transaction. Dollars per transaction increased for the four-week period due to an increase in units per transaction, partially offset by a decrease in average unit retail. With respect to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, I want to remind everyone that, formerly, our guidance involves some inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating sales, product margin, and earnings growth given the variety of internal and external factors that impact our performance. With our sales results in early fiscal 2024 showing a small step back from our Q4 trends, we entered 2024 with some caution. While we are optimistic that we could see continued improvement in the business as fiscal March-to-date sales have trended better with new spring receipts, we are planning more conservatively, anticipating total sales for the first quarter between $167 million and $172 million. We expect that our first quarter of 2024 product margins will be down year over year against the current backdrop but an improvement from our Q4 run rate. We believe that the first quarter of 2024 will see a continued negative impact on product margin related to a mix shift away from service and related shipping revenue in the prior-year results. While the product margin impact of this mix shift is negative, the overall impact of gross profit is negligible.
We do not anticipate this mix shift will have a material impact beyond our first quarter of 2024. Consolidated operating loss as a percentage of sales for the first quarter is expected to be between negative 15% and negative 17%, and we anticipate our loss per share will be between $1.09 and $1.19, compared to a loss of $0.96 in the prior year. As we consider the outlook for the full-year 2024, there remains uncertainty and volatility in the macro environment. Given this, we will refrain -- refrain from giving specific annual financial guidance but do want to add some context around how we currently believe the business will trend throughout the year. We have experienced several negative sales trends over the past two years driven by the pandemic, inflation, competition for the discretionary dollar, negative brand trends, and general global instability. Given the magnitude of the multiyear decline, we believe that we are beginning to see the impact of those negative business trends moderate, and our current results are showing the new trends are taking hold. This includes our men's category being positive across Q4 and into February.
At this time, we believe we can build upon these trends throughout 2024 and see total sales growth for the full year. After two years of difficult performance and product margin, we believe that with a more stable sales environment, we will grow product margin in 2024. With sales growth in 2024, we anticipate that we'll leverage SG&A costs year over year beyond the benefit we will receive of moving past the $41.1 million goodwill impairment charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023. With the previously mentioned assumptions, we believe will turn -- return to positive operating margins for the full year.
While effective tax rates are likely to fluctuate significantly by quarter, we anticipate that our full-year effective tax rate will be roughly 40% in fiscal 2024. We are planning to open 10 new stores during the year, including three in North America, three in Europe, and four stores in Australia. This is down from 19 stores in 2023 and 32 stores in 2022 as we focus on optimizing our current footprint. We expect our capital expenditures for 2024 to be between $14 million and $16 million, compared to $20.4 million in fiscal 2023 and $25.6 million in fiscal 2022. The reduction is primarily due to fewer planned store reopenings -- or store openings. We expect that depreciation and amortization excluding noncash lease expense will be approximately $23 million and consistent with the prior year.
We are currently projecting our diluted share count for the full year to be approximately 19.8 million shares. And with that, operator, we'd like to open the call up for questions.
Questions & Answers:

Operator
Thank you. At this time, we'll conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Corey Tarlowe -- Jefferies -- Analyst
Great. Thanks and good afternoon. As it relates to Europe, where are you seeing green shoots, and then where are you seeing opportunities to improve as we look ahead and you assess the viability of certain regions or areas in which you're currently present as you think about the -- the go-forward outlay for that region for your business?.
Rick Brooks -- Chief Executive Officer
All right, I'll start, Corey, and then Chris can add on to -- add on his comments too. I think that there really is -- what's important in this conversation is a pivot in Europe away from store growth because obviously we were growing sales in -- in Europe over the last few years, but sales have been challenged relative to our expectations for the sales growth that we expect to see in Europe. And opening new markets is an expensive proposition. So, what you're really seeing us do here is say we need to cut -- we need to really refocus our team's efforts on going back and giving them the time and the bandwidth to go back and really focus on building out profitability in our existing markets. And that's our focus.
And as we -- as we comment in the script, we've seen some good results in -- particularly in Germany last year, which is our -- I think our biggest market in terms of unit count in Europe. We had a double-digit gain in the year. We made significant progress relative to profitability in that market, but we have more progress to make, Corey. And I guess that's what you're seeing, as I'm saying here, is we're going to put a pause on growth, build a profitable base, and then reconsider where we go from there. So, this is more about basics, it's about the fundamentals and tactics.
And we have markets that are profitable in Europe, to be clear, but this is about getting them all moving in a -- in a -- in the right direction. Getting back to that, what are our teams look like in every location, driving better product margins across the business, controlling and managing expenses more effectively by not -- again, reducing the cost of entering new markets as an example. And so, we're back to basics, and I would tell you much the same thing about here in our -- in our North American business too. So, I think of more about perspective of we have opportunity there and we have opportunity to grow the profitability on a -- for all basis across those markets and win our web business in -- in Europe. So, it's really about the pivot, slowing growth, focusing on building that profitable base, doing and executing the basics, and putting all of our efforts into that.
Corey Tarlowe -- Jefferies -- Analyst
Great, thanks. And then, I have two more if I can. On North America, the men's business seems to have made a turn. How do you think about the prospects for that to potentially drive maybe perhaps a more widespread momentum across the other categories of the business now that you've seen the turn there? And then, just briefly on store count, on the -- I believe it's 10 openings that you're anticipating.
What would be the net number for the full year?
Rick Brooks -- Chief Executive Officer
All right, great. I'll take the first part, and again, Chris, add on as you like. So, the North American business, I -- the good news, this is -- you know, I have good news for you on North America is the improvement in our North American business is directly related to the comments we made in the script earlier. Our private label business is dead on. I think the trends were doing really fun, creative things there.
Multiple trends are working for us in private label, and private label is growing in absolute dollars despite the overall sales decline. We're not declining in private label on a relative basis. Not a gain share on a -- on a relative basis, it's a gain in absolute dollars in our business in private label. So, we have a lot of momentum there.
And I think we're on the early edge. I think we've been not just on those trends, but we've been leading the trend cycles that we're seeing out to the market. So, that is a huge driver for private label. It also has, I think, a positive benefit of women's that we'll see play out over time in terms of what we're doing on the women's side with our private-label brands. And again, it's both about the freshness we can offer the consumer and being on those trends, building those trends for our customer, as well as the value proposition we have by the move, the ability we have with private label to do bundling and things like that for customers to provide more value for them beyond just cheap prices. That's never been our strategy.
The second thing on men's that's really I think again directly correlated to the results we're seeing, and we comment on this in the script too, is that the emerging brands in '22 and '23 -- and I will tell you, particularly in '23, the brands we launched in '23. And in some cases, the brands we launched in the back half of 2023 are gaining significant share in our business and have been doing so month over month, quarter -- better, deeper penetration in Q4 than Q3. And so, this is the newness -- when we talk about injecting newness into the business, this is what we're talking about, and we're seeing it resonate, and that these trends that we're seeing are the exact things that are driving our positive trend in the men's business. So, as we think about that, with new brands, Corey -- Corey, what we'll look to do there in terms of broad amount of categories is we'll look to do exactly that, which is how can we take a screen or brand and get them into accessories -- in different accessories categories, how can we partner with -- with -- collab and things like that with these brands to help drive more sales for them, how can we expand them to new categories of business? These are the things will be working with -- you know, again not all of them, but select brand partners to try to drive even more sales results. And I just think these are -- again, we're new in a lot of these, we're going to -- these are just -- these are brands that are -- just continue to gain share.
And again, we intend to launch a lot more new brands throughout 2024. That's always our goal every year. So, I just want to be clear, there's a direct correlation between what we're seeing in the improving trend results and the -- and new brands and the efforts we put into private label. So, they're -- they're directly correlated, and they're driving to better results. And I think we can expand it to other categories, absolutely.
And potentially, we'll be able to lever some of that benefit for other departments within the business too
Chris Work -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, and I just add a couple quantification points to men's before I answer your question around store count that, you know, men's -- men's as a percentage of our total sales grew from 43% to 47%, which I think is a -- is a strong metric for our business. And it ties into some of the thoughts we gave annually as far as the belief that we think we can grow sales for the year. What I think is really good about the men's business is it turned positive in back to school. While it wasn't positive for all of Q3, it was positive during that six-week period, and then again turned positive in November and December during the peak, and now, has remained positive in January and February. I bring that up because as we look back on the business and we look at other periods that have been a little more challenging from a financial perspective for us, it the last one being '15 and '16, men's really was , and specifically men's t shirts, was really was the -- the driver for us coming out in growth of '17, '18, '19.
So, again, I give our buying teams a lot of credit here. This is about finding newness and brands that will stick and -- and men's really is the driving category. So, I think it's a good call-out from you to ask. From a store count perspective, I guess, what we plan to do right now and what we said in the script is that we would probably open 10 stores and close 20 to 25 stores. But in answering that question, I do want to step back because we also noted that we closed 21 stores in 2023. So, you know, as you think about that on a two-year combined closure, it is a pretty significant closure cycle for us and really not a territory we've been in before.
So, I want to be careful in getting closure numbers. Because of the 20 to 24 closures in 2024, I mean this could increase or decrease as we move through the year depending on, you know, how our results go and -- and our ability to work both with our landlord partners, as well as, you know, internally on some of the things that -- that we -- that we control. And when it comes to closures, it's not a process we really take lightly either. We have a pretty detailed process to look at closures. We try to factor in things, obviously, the sales and profitability levels of the specific location in question. But we also look at what does that store mean to its trade area.
And as we think about serving that customer, what other opportunities do we have around that store to -- to impact that customer. We look at the condition of the center and, you know, how the landlord's plans for the center are playing into the location in regards to vacancies and the ability to -- to bring newness to a location. And then, you know, we look at peak performance and working through if some of the declines we see in our business right now are permanent or temporary based on the current state of the market. I think that's a really important thing that we do and then, you know, what else we can do about the store economics. So, we go through a pretty diligent process.
I think after factoring in all of those things, if we make the determination it's a store to close, it probably means that it's in a location or a mall that is -- is, you know, one of the declining centers that we have in our country and -- and something that will -- we'll close. So, for 2023, the majority of our closures were in North America. In 2024, we anticipate that will hold true, although we do expect some closures in Europe as well. You know, this will be -- it does have an impact on overall sales, although, again, I mean despite this, which we estimate to be about $10 million and the 53rd week, we still think we can grow sales in excess of those amounts.
Corey Tarlowe -- Jefferies -- Analyst
Very helpful. Thank you so much and best of luck.
Rick Brooks -- Chief Executive Officer
Thank you.
Operator
One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Mitch Kummetz with Seaport. Please proceed with your question.
Mitch Kummetz -- Seaport Research Partners -- Analyst
Yes, thanks for taking my questions. I've got maybe a few housekeeping and then maybe a couple that are a little more strategic because I think you maybe partly answered my first question. Just on the 53rd week, what was the sales and earnings impact in '23, was that the 10 million in sales that you just referenced? I -- maybe I didn't hear that correctly.
Chris Work -- Chief Financial Officer
No. The 10 million in sales is -- is referencing the closures, the amount that the 21 stores we closed are worth in -- in sales. The 53rd week is going to be worth about $12 million.
Mitch Kummetz -- Seaport Research Partners -- Analyst
And what about on the earnings?
Chris Work -- Chief Financial Officer
It's about $1.8 million of operating profit.
Mitch Kummetz -- Seaport Research Partners -- Analyst
OK, that's helpful. Thank you. And then, on the -- on the 1Q guide, you gave us a sales range. Is there sort of a comp assumption that's embedded in that range?
Chris Work -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, the comp assumption, and this year, we'll have a little bit of a negative spread obviously because of how the closures impact it. So -- but it won't be that significantly different than the range we gave.
Mitch Kummetz -- Seaport Research Partners -- Analyst
OK, and then on the full year, you -- again, you expect sales growth, and I want to say that that's inclusive of the 53rd week in '23. So, maybe just to confirm that. But then also, given -- given the net store closures that you're anticipating, I assume that you're expecting comp growth for the year? Can you just confirm that?
Chris Work -- Chief Financial Officer
Correct. Yeah, when we talked about -- you know, we didn't give specific guidance for the year or numbers, obviously, just given kind of the uncertainty and what's ahead. But we are planning the business with sales growth, factoring in both the 53rd week challenge that we'll have, as well as the $10 million in store closures.
Mitch Kummetz -- Seaport Research Partners -- Analyst
Is the -- is the -- so, if there's comp growth in '24, do you anticipate, you know, some of that coming from just like -- now that you've slowed the growth or shut down the growth of -- of stores in Europe, is there an opportunity for comp growth in Europe, just kind of from -- from -- from the standpoint of like how much ramp, or do you see that as an opportunity?
Chris Work -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, I think I would look at this -- I'm going to take just your question a little bit higher level and then I'll come into Europe. I think when we're looking at this business, we think we have opportunity for comp growth really across the business, specifically because of, you know, what we know this business has been able to do and where we have landed here these last couple of years, which is, you know, pretty disappointing to us, to be quite frank. But we're looking at many of these locations knowing that, you know, we've got good locations. We've got, you know, buyers that are really honed in on finding the right product for what's next.
We've got good sales teams that are out there to serve the customers. And so, as we -- as we tie this together and we think about 2024, we think we have a good opportunity. Now, earlier in this call, we talked about men's as being an opportunity, and I think that's a really good place for our business to start. I think each of our other categories, you know, have had some challenges as well. So, as we look at those and we look at some of these new brands that Rick spoke to and the fact that, you know, we continue to bring a lot of newness into the business, we think we have opportunity in our other categories as well.
Geographically, we know that North America has been challenged. You know, it has been just as much, if not more than Europe. So – so, we know that that in the U.S., we've got opportunity. We believe we have opportunity in Canada.
And as it comes to Europe, I think you're absolutely right, we've got a lot of new units. We've been very focused on new markets and growth. And as Rick said, we're sort of pausing that with the idea that we -- we need to grow comp and we need to focus on the customer and get back to basics to drive to profitability and cash flow, right, within that region. And then, I think once we get to that level, we have the opportunity to -- to rethink about growth because there still is a lot of growth in Europe. I don't want to give the impression that the growth is not there.
We just have to be able to do it in a profitable way with cash flow. And -- and as we think about Europe individually, I mean, despite the pullback we saw in overall sales, I mean, Europe did comp in 2023. It just did not comp to a level that we needed it to, especially in light of what you've seen with wage inflation and some of the other costs that have gone up in Europe. So, I -- you know, I believe there's comp opportunity across the business, and I think that's why you're hearing us, you know, be pretty confident about the ability to -- to grow sales despite the fact that we've got the 53rd week and some closures, you know, that we've got to overcome.
Mitch Kummetz -- Seaport Research Partners -- Analyst
OK, and then maybe two last ones are a bit more strategic. One, on the new brands, it sounds like the benefit that you're seeing there is mostly on the men's side. Is there also -- I think, Rick, you mentioned the opportunity to do more in women's with private label, but there is also an opportunity to add brands to help the women's business. That'd be my first question. And then, secondly, one month doesn't make a trend, but footwear, it looks like, was positive in February.
I'm just wondering to what, you know -- is that really a function of that you're just starting to lap easier compares? Or have you also kind of worked on sort of pivoting the footwear assortment to try to drive better results there?
Rick Brooks -- Chief Executive Officer
All right, thanks for the question, Mitch. First, I guess, just for clarity purposes around brands, we have some brands that are new brands we've launched that are working well in women, so be clear about that and -- and where it's really made a difference in the business, just not enough to tip it to the positive at this stage of the game. And private label, we have a lot of good stuff there too. So, we're -- and then other brands that we're launching that are predominately having the benefit of men's, we know there's also a unisex aspect to how our customer buys product.
So, it becomes a little harder for me to quantify that for you to how it's impacting women, but that's -- that -- that -- we see that throughout our business with -- with -- with women buying boy's shoes as an example would be another example where we know it's happening based upon the seismic that we see playing out there, or we see it in t shirts where we're selling small size of the men's disproportionately to our typical business. So – so, it's a little bit hard to answer that question, Mitch, just because we know there's this unisex aspect to our business, particularly with women in the -- in the business. But, yes, we do have some brands that are specifically new in the women's business and we're seeing some success, just not enough to tip it to the positive at this point. So, we're always looking for brands across wide ranges that we think will really be relevant for all of our customers, I would guess, would be the -- the message halfway there. On footwear, in February, yes, it was positive, and -- but it was a really promotionally driven positive number. So, what I will tell you about footwear, Mitch, is -- is we have just been clearing footwear aggressively.
And we've had a lot of footwear. We've had some good help from our brand partners here in doing this, but as you know, it's been an issue and a challenged department for a while now. And so, what you're seeing us do is get inventory into position so that we can really go after newness in footwear. So, I think, Chris, inventory in footwear was down --
Chris Work -- Chief Financial Officer
Thirty percent.
Rick Brooks -- Chief Executive Officer
Thirty percent at the end of the year, Mitch. It should give you a sense of where we're at on the footwear inventory. We have aggressively -- been aggressive about clearing it out. And again, great support from our brand partners in helping us do that.
And we've done it also through liquidation. So, what you're really seeing over the last month is aggressive liquidation in the footwear market. Now, as we look forward, we definitely have some trends that are working and I'm sure you're identifying them on our footwear wall. And so, now it's about the right levels of inventory. It's about we're going to ride the trends that we know are working that really actually go together with the trends that are in our private label business, particularly in long bottoms. They're going to drive, I think, some that -- that will drive improved business in footwear.
And then, what our teams have done is we have a -- basically you -- if you were to see our plan for footwear throughout 2024, I think we have a really solid plan for injecting newness throughout the year on a regular -- pretty -- pretty regular basis. Period buy period, we're going to see us launch newness and build as we move -- really try to build and adjust as we move toward back to school and holiday with what works in the assortment and how we reposition our footwear wall for the -- to really hit those peak periods as best we can. So, I think the key takeaway on footwear is, yes, it was, but it was promotionally driven. Liquidation mode, I would say. But as we look forward, we now have inventory in a position where we can really go out and make investments really try -- as you know, it's a -- footwear is tough.
Because of the size -- the sizing, you do have to make larger investments in each style of footwear you try. So, we're going to do now is just go out there and have some fun. We're going to play our brand. Partners, again, are being incredibly supportive here, and we have a lot of newness coming in every period in footwear.
Mitch Kummetz -- Seaport Research Partners -- Analyst
All right, thanks. I look forward to seeing some size 14s in your stores. I appreciate you taking all my questions.
Rick Brooks -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, not that much newness, Mitch, so.
Operator
[Operator instructions] That concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Rick Brooks for closing remarks.

Questions & Answers:

Operator
I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, executive chairman and co-CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller -- Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer
Very good. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. I'm in Miami today, together with Jon Jaffe, our co-CEO and president; Diane Bessette, our chief financial officer; David Collins, who you just heard from, our controller and vice president; Bruce Gross, our CEO of Lennar Financial Services; and a few others are here with us as well. As usual, I'm going to give a macro and strategic overview of the company.
After my introductory remarks, Jon is going to give an operational overview, updating construction costs, cycle time, and some of our land strategy and position. As usual, Diane is going to give a detailed financial highlight, along with some limited guidance for the second quarter and full year '24. And then, of course, we'll have our Q&A session. As usual, I'd like to ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many as possible.
So, let's go ahead and begin. We're very pleased to report another very solid and consistent quarter of operating results for Lennar. We continue to execute our operating plan effectively into the first quarter, driving excellent operating results, and we have simply never been better positioned from balance sheet to execution to operating strategy to address market conditions as they unfold for the remainder of '24 and beyond. In the first quarter, we started 18,338 homes, we sold 18,176 homes, and we delivered 16,798 homes, while we expect deliveries for the year to be approximately 10% higher than last year at 80,000 homes.
Next quarter, we expect to start approximately 21,000 homes, sell approximately 21,000 homes, and deliver between 19,000 and 19,500 homes. Admittedly, we aren't quite there yet, but we are getting closer and closer to an even flow manufacturing model that we believe will continue to enhance our cash flow, our bottom line, as well as our predictability. Last year, we grew at a 10% pace in a very difficult year, and we believe we'll grow at a 10% pace again this year in a complicated economic -- in complicated economic conditions. And it is being done by a carefully designed program to maintain volume, maximize efficiencies and cost reductions around production, maintain even flow of production and sales, and rebuild our asset base and balance sheet in order to drive cash flow, effective capital allocation, and higher returns.
That is total shareholder returns, returns on assets, and returns on equity. I know I didn't mention margin yet, that's because, as I've said before, margin is the springing mechanism that enables all of this to happen. This quarter, our margin was 21.8%, somewhat higher than expected. And next quarter, we expect our margin to be approximately 22.5%, depending on market conditions.
And for the full year, we expect margin to be approximately the same as last year's full year margin of 23.3%. But that, of course, will depend on market conditions as well. We will see. Additionally, we continue to drive strong cash flow and allocate over $500 million to repurchase 3.4 million shares of stock and improve our balance sheet with a homebuilding debt to total capital ratio of under 10%.
While we know we have accumulated a sizable $5 billion of cash on our book, we are crafting our strategy for appropriate capital allocation. Overall, the macroeconomic environment remains relatively strong for the new homebuilders. The general theme remains primarily focused around very strong demand for housing, limited by the chronic housing shortage that is particularly problematic for working-class families and their ability to find affordable or attainable supply. Demand for that product remains robust if it can be built at an attainable price point.
The economic environment driving demand has been relatively favorable, supported by low unemployment and fairly strong consumer confidence. Generally speaking, consumers remain employed, they are confident that they will remain employed, and they believe that their compensation is likely to rise. This is most often the foundation of a very strong housing market. Along with the supply shortage, the additional limiting factor continues to center around affordability, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and stubborn inflation.
With higher interest rates, affordability continues to be tested as higher monthly payments make qualifying for a loan increasingly difficult. At the same time, inflationary pressures have driven traditional cost of living expenses higher over the past two years, which has made saving for a down payment increasingly difficult. Higher prices have also started to lead to increased personal and credit card debt as families stretched to pay their bills. We've started to see early evidence of debt delinquency showing up and derailing some mortgage applications.
While interest rates have continued to move higher and lower as the Fed continues to seek economic data indicating that inflation has been controlled, the consumer has been navigating an affordability gauntlet. The new homebuilders have worked out a variety of incentive structures that range from interest rate buydowns to closing cost pickups to price reductions, all designed to meet the purchaser at the intersection of need and affordability. Those incentives have increased and decreased as interest rates have moved up and down. Homebuilders have been uniquely able to capture demand by using these incentives to unlock the affordability constraint and enable purchasers to transact.
Against this backdrop, our first quarter -- in our first quarter, we've been focused on and consistent in executing our core operating strategy. We've continued to migrate to a pure-play manufacturing model across our homebuilding platform and each of our 40 homebuilding divisions in order to reduce production costs while we generate consistent cash flow. Additionally, we are reengineering our products for efficiency and volume in order to enhance our inventory turn and grow volume to contribute to build a balanced and, therefore, healthier overall housing market. We have also continued to migrate to a land-light balance sheet while we grow our business and expand market share in order to drive total shareholder returns, return on inventory, and return on equity.
We are, so to speak, continuing to modernize and upgrade the Lennar airplane while we are flying the plane and putting execution and safety first as we fly. It has been a busy and productive quarter for Lennar, and we continue to execute in the short term while we continue to build our platform for continued and future success. So, let me break some of this down. On the operational side, we are running under a by-design operational model, where we are starting homes at a pace designed to increase market share while we maximize logistics and efficiencies in order to benefit from reduced construction costs.
Our trade partners are given visibility on starts and timing expectations so that they can be more efficient and help pass efficiency savings onto our customers through more affordable products. By driving volume, we gain market share in most of our core markets as we lean in when others pull back. Our trade partners see a consistent and dependable partner that is worthy of the designation of builder of choice. We work side by side with our trade partners while we attract additional trade partner relationships.
Participants find that they have dependable and consistent work with our production strategy, which leads to higher productivity and, therefore, cost savings. Through market share growth in local markets, we enhance the ability to better manage our costs, enhance our efficiency of operation, reduce cycle times with efficient production templates, and enhance our inventory turn. Jon will discuss this in more detail in just a few minutes. Driving our confidence to start homes at pace in order to achieve maximum efficiency in the field is the Lennar machine.
The machine is a combined program of digital marketing, sales consultants engagement, and dynamic pricing. We've described the machine in prior calls, and many of you have now come to our office to see it in action. The machine has completely changed the manner in which we sell homes and enables us to drive maximum efficient production. If we build a home, we sell that home.
We sell by digitally acquiring leads to our digital marketing program, then we filter those leads so the best leads go directly to our sales professionals. They nurture those best leads or customers, while our dynamic pricing model assists in dynamically tailoring pricing in real time to meet the market given consumer desires, market conditions, and competitive factors. The dynamically adjusted pricing using incentives or price alterations automatically adjusts our margins up or down while we maintain production and sales pace. We set the production to efficiency, we match sales pace to production, and we deliver the homes we build while we carefully maintain controlled inventory levels, all while reducing production costs and driving consistent cash flow.
I know it all sounds easy, but it's not, but this has been a core pillar of the programming that we've been reworking over the past years, and it's really starting to kick in and work quite well. Next, to our laser focus on volume, with production and sales being in even better alignment, we are intensifying our focus on producing affordable and attainable product across our platform. We've recognized that the chronic housing shortage is a critical issue and it's more than just a great talking point. The reality is that our industry needs to find solutions to building a healthier housing market that is attainable to participants across the economic landscape.
Working-class housing is essential to the effective working of our cities across the country, and we hear that from mayors and governors everywhere. So, we've been working on using our strategies for production and cost efficiencies to help build a healthier housing market that is accessible to everyone. Of course, it all starts with lower production costs across our platform. Land we know is getting more expensive.
Impact fees also are getting more expensive. And labor costs have been rising as well. We can only reduce our input costs by increasing productivity to efficiencies of our operation. Our focus has been on doing just that.
We're building more consistent products that we call our core products that are carefully value-engineered, and we are using our start pace to enable an engineered production cycle as well, enabling us to reduce cycle time and to work with our trade partners to build efficiencies in logistics and the way that we run our community production. We've also continued working on additional product approaches to help build a healthier housing market. We've intensified our focus on build-to-rent that is community scale and single-family for-rent scattered homes sale markets. We believe that we can and need to build additional production for professionally owned housing that can fill an important need.
But those professional purchasers need cost efficiencies in today's interest rate environment in order to make their rents attainable, and we can provide that. There are families who are building their future and aspire to single-family lifestyle with backyards and schools and parks, but who can't yet afford a down payment or don't have the credit characteristics to qualify the mortgage that they need. Institutional buyers are filling that void for those families. Many across the industry have criticized the professionally owned market and the investor class that competes with primary homeowners to purchase product for rentals.
This is flawed thinking. Those investors are actually filling a critical need for the underserved families who seek to bridge the lifestyle for their family while they build the down payment and credit score to ultimately achieve homeownership. This is the critical equitable side of home production. And the institutional buyers are not competitors to the primary buyers.
They are additive to the valuable housing stock, enabling those who don't have a family that can help them achieve the lifestyle they want while they build their capital capacity. We are working across our platform with our institutional partners to produce more structured programs to provide more housing for those who need professional ownership as a stepping stone for the ultimate home of their own. We are also engaging our blue chip multifamily platform to build attainable rental products in an off-balance sheet configuration. We have a strong history of successfully building multifamily product across the country.
We have been building those products in an off-balance sheet configuration, and we expect to continue to build this vital attainable product without encumbering our balance sheet. Finally, we have built and continue to refine our land strategy by design as well in order to dovetail with our production orientation. Every home that is going to be built needs a homesite with a permit, and those homesites need to be auctioned and off-balance sheet until we're ready to build. We continue to focus on a just-in-time delivery program for land, just like we have for lumber and appliances and other products, and we continue to make excellent progress in this regard.
We accomplished this by both negotiating option deals with landowners and developers, and we also -- and also creating structured land bank strategies, often with private equity capital. By consistently focusing on our land-light strategy, we have materially enhanced and generated consistent cash flow through the ups and downs of interest rate changes, and we've enhanced our balance sheet and our liquidity, even after redeeming debt and purchasing stock over the past years, along with purchasing $500 million of shares of stock through this quarter. Our balance sheet is situated today with a 9.6% homebuilding debt to total cap ratio, with $5 billion of cash on hand and $0 drawn on our revolver, and with an expected $3.5 billion, plus or minus, of net cash flow over this next year. Accordingly, we have the flexibility to allocate capital strategically, first, of course, to grow, while also retiring debt, paying appropriate dividends, and repurchasing shares of Lennar stock.
Accordingly, this quarter, we raised our dividend to $2 per share and authorized an additional $5 billion of stock repurchases as we continue to drive total shareholder returns. Even with these capital allocations, many have suggested that given the tremendous success of our migration to our land-light program, we have accumulated too much cash on our balance sheet, which limits the ability of our returns to move higher. While we have understood the concern, we have remained patient as we have evolved not just the migration to the land-light configuration, but also have remained focused on the long-term durability of the land bank structures involved. Private equity capital can be fickle.
By driving volume through these programs, we have gained advantaged insights into and refined the workings of our strategic land banks. The underlying plumbing systems for the land banks has been refined, and questions have now been answered as to the durability of the capital partners that make up the counterparty relationships with their homebuilding partner, namely us. Our consistent volume helped define both trust and dependability and has taken those relationships to another level as neither party flinched as market conditions tested the boundaries of relationships. While adjustments were made and lessons were learned, the structures and relationships became stronger and more durable.
Accordingly, we have now rekindled our focus on a strategic spinoff that can be cleanly focused on fortifying durable land strategy. By spinning our own land -- excess land in a taxable spin, we believe that we can create an additional vote with permanent capital vehicle that can option developed homesites to Lennar and recycle capital into new homesites while distributing market-appropriate returns to shareholders. We have stood up a strong land vehicle that is under consideration, currently with about $4 billion of land. It could be more.
It could be less. And it is under development and consideration right now. Such a transaction would distribute capital to shareholders, it would reduce inventory on Lennar's books, and it would provide permanent dependable capital for future land options. Our balance sheet would remain very strong with consistent earnings and cash flow to contribute to pay down debt and continue to repurchase stock.
We know we've had a false start on a prior spin concept, and there's no promise of certainty or completion on this program. But on the positive side, our chief operating officer, Fred Rothman, is singularly focused on this initiative, and Fred likes to get things done. We'll keep you apprised of progress, but progress should happen relatively quickly as this transaction is far simpler in structure. With that said, let me conclude by saying that our first quarter of 2024 has been another strategic and operational success for our company.
While market conditions have remained challenging, we have consistently learned and found ways to address market needs. We know that demand is strong and there is a chronic housing supply shortage that needs to be filled. We will continue to drive production to meet the housing shortage that we know persists across markets. With that said, as interest rates subside and normalize and if the Fed is going to begin to actually cut rates, we believe that pent-up demand will be activated, and we will be well positioned and well prepared.
If not, we will continue to produce volume and increase market share. To date, we have seen overall market conditions remain generally constructive for the industry. Even though higher interest rates have remained sticky, strong pent-up demand has found ways to access the housing market. Given consistent execution, we are extremely well-positioned for even greater successes as strong demand for affordable offering continues to seek short supply.
Perhaps, most importantly, our extraordinarily strong balance sheet affords us flexibility and opportunity to consider and execute upon thoughtful innovation for our future. We have the luxury to continue to execute flawlessly in the short term, while we continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividend and stock buybacks, while we also, and I emphasize the word also, pursue strategic distribution to shareholders that fortifies our future as well. We have clearly earned an enviable position. As we look ahead to a successful 2024, we are well-positioned for and expect to see much more of the same.
We are confident that by design, we will continue to grow, to perform, and to drive Lennar to new levels of consistent and predictable performance. We are guiding to 19,000 to 19,500 closings next quarter, with approximately a 22.5% margin. And we expect to deliver approximately 80,000 homes this year, with a little over a 23% margin. We also expect to repurchase in excess of $2 billion of stock as we continue to drive very strong cash flow.
We look forward to a very strong year. And for that, I want to thank the extraordinary associates of Lennar for their tremendous focus, effort, and talent. And with that, let me turn it over to Jon.
Jon Jaffe -- President and Co-Chief Executive Officer
Good morning. As you heard from Stuart, our operational teams at Lennar continued the execution of our core operating strategies in our first quarter. The focus starts with the Lennar marketing and sales machine. Every quarter, our divisions continuously learn from their engagement with the Lennar machine, gain knowledge on how to use this information for decision-making, provide feedback for enhancements, and improve the machine and execution of our strategies.
This continuous loop of learnings and improvements drives applied analytics, which enables us to improve our matching of sales to our production pace. You can see this evolution -- you can see the evolution of this improvement in our operating results as sales were evenly matched with starts in the first quarter and are projected to be evenly matched again in the second quarter. While there's more progress to be made, this matching of sales and production is leveling out our closings from quarter to quarter. The goal is even flow deliveries where by design starts gradually increase quarter over quarter to ultimately provide a consistent number of deliveries throughout the year.
This operating model produces the most significant of all the efficiencies that benefit our trade partners. To optimize the pricing of each home, this strategy is more than just about selling -- about the pace of sales, but about selling the right homes at the right price. In every division, Mondays are now referred to as Machine Mondays. Our operating teams gather to review dashboards, informing them with the prior week's results compared to the planned activity.
This analysis of the prior week's activity from digital marketing leads to sales pace and price of homes sold is evaluated to see if we sold the right homes, thus informing our decision-making and the plotted course of action for the current week. As the week unfolds, this is reevaluated to make adjustments. All of this analysis enables each division to make ongoing adjustments, matching sales to unsold production as homes progress toward completion. In our first quarter, as interest rates fluctuated, this process informed us as to where we have pricing power or where we need buydown of interest rates and/or other incentives to maintain the desired pace.
The confidence we have in this by-design sales strategy allows us to maintain consistent starts. These starts lead to increased market share. This has seen a growth of 28% in sales and 23% in deliveries year over year as our consistent starts have filled the void of other builders who pulled back. This consistency of starts and the related share gain have positioned Lennar with a No.
1 or 2 market share in 33 of our 40 operating divisions, with 23 of these 33 divisions having the No. 1 market share. Here are some examples of our markets where we have both the leading market share position and also have increased that share. In the Carolinas, market share in Raleigh improved to 20%, up from 16%; and Charleston at 24%, up from 22%.
In the Midwest, our market share in Indianapolis was up 7% to 34%, Minnesota was up 4% to 29%, and Chicago was up 5% to 24%. Our market share in San Antonio grew by 6% to almost 24%. In San Diego, we grew from 35% to 40%; in Central Valley, from 31% to 38%; and in Tucson, from 14% to 18%. In Florida, our market share increased in Tampa from 15% to 21%; and in Jacksonville, from 17% to 24%.
Here in Miami, while we did not grow our industry-leading market share, we did maintain a very healthy 75% share. Our sales pace of 4.9 homes per community in Q1 is up from the pace of 3.9 in Q1 of last year. This increase was by design to match the starts pace of 4.9 from the fourth quarter of 2023. In our first quarter, the 30-year fixed rate was 7.37% at the start of the quarter, then down to 6.75% in the middle of January, and back up above 7% in the middle of February.
Using insights from dynamic pricing, our homebuilding teams work closely with our Lennar mortgage teams to find the right mortgage solutions homebuyer by homebuyer. On the cycle time and construction cost, as we continuously improve the way we execute this game plan, we are also continuously working to deepen the partnerships with our trade partners. We focus on maintaining both a high volume and a consistent volume of homes under construction. These and the other efficiencies discussed benefit our trade partners, enabling us to lower construction costs in a cooperative manner with our trades.
By consistently starting homes, even as interest rates rose above 7% during the quarter, we increased our starts by 38% from the prior year, and they were flat sequentially from Q4. This consistent and increased level of starts attracts a larger trade base to Lennar and, together with a normalized supply chain, led to another meaningful improvement in our cycle time. For the first quarter, cycle time decreased by seven days sequentially from Q4, down to 154 days, on average, for single-family homes, a 30% decrease year over year. The cycle time stabilizing, combined with our ongoing efficiency gains, we are now designing build templates that will further reduce cycle time on future starts.
We focus on the building blocks of volume, consistency, predictability, cycle time, and even flow to achieve production efficiencies, enabling our trade partners to lower their supply chain and labor costs. Looking at the first quarter, as expected, our construction costs fell sequentially from Q4 by about 2% and, on a year-over-year basis, by about 11%. Moving forward, to drive further efficiencies and cost reductions, we are laser-focused on the consistent use of highly value-engineered home plans, which, as Stuart mentioned, we call our core product strategy. This strategy has recently begun implementation in Texas and is scheduled to be rolled out in Florida this year and will follow, thereafter, in the rest of our markets.
These engineered efficiencies, together with significantly higher use frequency of these core plans, will further cement our position as the builder of choice for our trade partners. The reduced cost and time to build these core plans will help us achieve the goal of delivering attainable housing to meet the needs of the homebuying consumer. Next, I'll discuss our land-light strategy. In the first quarter, we continue to effectively work with our strategic land and land bank partners where they purchase land on our behalf and then deliver just-in-time homesites to our homebuilding machine, as Stuart described.
In the first quarter, about 80% of our $1.6 billion of land acquisitions in the quarter were finished homesites purchased from these various land structures. This 80% reflects a prior -- reflects a view of prior land purchased into these structures that is now being delivered to us for home starts. In the first quarter, about 90% of our new land acquisitions were acquired into our off-balance sheet land structures. We continue to make significant progress in the first quarter as our years of supply owned -- year supply of owned homesites improved to 1.3 years, down from 1.9 years, and our controlled homesite percentage increased to 77% from 68% year over year.
The bottom line is focusing on our operating strategies, which result in a reduced cycle time, and the reduction in land owned has increased our cash flow, as well as improved our inventory turn, which now stands at 1.5 versus 1.3 last year, a 15% increase. In the first quarter, we continued to refine the execution of the strategies Stuart and I have reviewed with you. From the Lennar marketing and sales machine to our production processes and land strategies, our focus is consistent, improvements are continuous, and change is ever-present. Stuart said it sounds simple, but it isn't.
It's a lot of hard work, a lot of trial and error, and it takes a lot of grit. Fortunately, we have a great team of associates who have leaned into each of these strategies and are executing at the highest levels. I want to add my appreciation for their hard work and dedication. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Diane.
Diane Bessette -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Jon. Good morning, everyone. Since Stuart and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilding performance, so, therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our financial services operations, summarize again our balance sheet highlights, and then provide high-level estimates for Q2 2024. So, starting with financial services.
For the first quarter, our financial services team had operating earnings of 131 million. Mortgage operating earnings were 100 million, compared to 59 million in the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by an increase in lock volume, which was the result of higher homebuilding volume and a higher capture rate, as well as higher profit per locked loan, which resulted from higher secondary margins and lower cost per loan as the team continues to focus on efficiencies. Title operating earnings were 33 million, compared to 23 million in the prior year.
Title earnings increased primarily as a result of higher volume and greater productivity as the team continues to embrace technology to run a more efficient business. These solid results were accomplished as a result of great synergies between our homebuilding and financial services teams. They truly represent the spirit of one Lennar. So, now, turning to our balance sheet.
This quarter, once again, we were steadfast in our determination to turn our inventory and generate cash by maintaining production and pricing homes to market, with the goal of delivering as many homes as possible to meet housing demand. The results of these actions was that we ended the quarter with $5 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $2.6 billion revolving credit facility. This provided a total liquidity of 7.6 billion. As a result of our continued focus on balance sheet efficiency and reducing our capital investments, we once again made significant progress on our goal of becoming asset-light.
As Jon mentioned, at quarter-end, our years owned improved to 1.3 years from 1.9 years in the prior year and our homesites controlled increased to 77% from 68% in the prior year, our lowest years owned and highest controlled percent in our history. At quarter-end, we owned just under 97,000 homesites and controlled 323,000 homesites for a total of 420,000 homesites. We believe this portfolio provides us with a strong competitive position to continue to grow market share in a capital-efficient way. As Jon mentioned, we spent 1.6 billion on land purchases this quarter.
However, 80% were finished homesites where vertical construction will soon begin. This is consistent with our manufacturing model of buying land on a just-in-time basis, which is less capital-intensive. Our goal is that, over time, we will continue to reduce our ownership of land and purchase homesites on a just-in-time basis, and our earnings should more consistently approximate cash flow as the need to invest -- reinvest it back in the business is lessened. And finally, looking at returns, our inventory turn was 1.5 times and our return on inventory was 30.5%.
During the quarter and consistent with our production focus, we started about 18,300 homes and ended the quarter with just under 40,000 total homes in inventory. This inventory number includes about 2,200 models and also includes about 1,000 homes that were completed unsold, which is less than one home per community as we successfully manage our finished inventory levels. Consistent with our commitment to strategic capital allocation, we repurchased 3.4 million of our outstanding shares for a total of 506 million. Additionally, during the quarter, as Stuart mentioned, we increased our annual dividend to $2 per share from $1.50 per share.
So, we paid total dividends this quarter of 139 million. And looking at our debt maturity profile, our next senior note maturity is 454 million, which is due in April 2024. So, next month. Then, there are no maturities until May of 2025.
We continue to benefit from our previous paydown of senior notes and strong earnings generation, which brought our homebuilding debt to total capital down to 9.6 at quarter-end, an improvement from 14.2 in the prior year. We remain committed to increasing shareholder returns. Our stockholders equity increased to almost 27 billion, and our book value per share increased to 95.74, and our return on equity was 15.8%. In summary, the strength of our balance sheet, strong liquidity, and low leverage provides us with significant confidence and financial flexibility as we move through 2024.
With that brief overview, I'd like to turn to Q2 and provide some high-level guidance. Starting with new orders. We expect Q2 new orders to be in the range of 20,900 to 21,300 homes as we keep our production pace and sales pace closely aligned. We anticipate Q2 deliveries to be in the range of 19,000 to 19,500 homes, with a continued focus of efficiently turning inventory into cash.
Our Q2 average sales price should be in the range of 420,000 to 425,000. We expect gross margins to be about 22.5% and our SG&A about 7.2%, with both estimates having some plus or minus, depending on market conditions. For the combined homebuilding joint venture, land sales, and other categories, we expect to have earnings of about 25 million. We anticipate our financial services earnings for Q2 to be in the range of 110 million to 115 million based on expected product mix in our mortgage operations.
We expect a loss of about 20 million for our multifamily business and also a loss of about 20 million for our Lennar other categories. The Lennar other estimate does not include any potential mark-to-market adjustments to our public technology investments since that adjustment will be determined by their stock prices at the end of the quarter. Our Q2 corporate G&A should be about 1.8% of total revenues, and our charitable contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivered. We expect our tax rate to be about 24.5%, and the weighted average share count should be approximately 274 million shares.
And so, on a combined basis, these estimates should produce an EPS range of approximately $3.15 to $3.25 per share for the second quarter. For the full year, we remain committed to delivering 80,000 homes, which is about a 10% growth year over year, with a gross margin that is consistent with last year's gross margin. We also remain confident with our cash flow generation, as we indicated. As such, we are still targeting a capital allocation of at least 2.5 billion, 454 million of which will be allocated to the April debt maturity that I mentioned and the balance to share repurchases.
And with that, let me turn it over to the operator.

Thank you. At this time, we'll -- we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And that comes from Alan Ratner with Zelman and Associates. Your line is open.
Alan Ratner -- Zelman and Associates -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Good morning. Nice quarter and thanks for all the great commentary so far. Very helpful.
Appreciate it. Stuart, you know, first one, I wanted to ask you, it sounds like you -- and maybe I'm reading too much into this, but it sounds like you were kind of touching on kind of mortgage qualification issues a little bit more than you have in recent quarters, and I'm curious if you've seen something specifically in the near term that is kind of leading you to highlight that, or if you're just kind of commenting more broadly on the fact that affordability is stretched, which I don't think is much of a surprise to anybody at this point.
Stuart Miller -- Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer
So, I think it starts with the fact that affordability is stretched, but we are definitely seeing a little bit more credit card debt and personal debt from the customer showing up in their applications. We have seen some delinquencies in some of that debt. Bruce, maybe you'd like to comment a little on that.
Bruce Gross -- Chief Executive Office, Lennar Financial Services
Sure. And I think what we're seeing is when you look at denials, in particular, more denials are having a higher percentage relating to debt to total income. So, there's more debt to pay off, and that's something new that we noticed this quarter. You know, we often work with the buyers, and we're able to work through a lot of the conditions, but that one point is something that we've seen differently this last quarter.
Alan Ratner -- Zelman and Associates -- Analyst
Gotcha. Bruce, great to hear your voice, and thank you for that info. And then second question, you know, it seems like the market is generally tracking in line with what you expected three months ago, and I think the guidance reflects that. You know, Stuart, I think three months ago, probably the -- really, the main difference is I think we and you and probably everybody, you know, were probably expecting rates to be lower by now, and some of the inflation metrics might be a little bit stickier than people were hoping for.
So, when you think about the margin guide for the back half of the year, you know, it does imply a pretty healthy ramp, and I think your comments last quarter suggested an expectation that as rates move down, you would be able to pull back a little bit on incentives and discounts. I'm just curious if that, you know, thought process has changed at all, or if you're seeing enough on the demand side today that, you know, you've either already done the heavy lifting on pulling back on incentives or you're confident that that's going to transpire over the next few months.
Stuart Miller -- Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer
So, really interesting question, Alan, and let's start with the fact that demand is strong. And I can't emphasize that enough, that demand is strong. Now, with that said, there's limited supply and there's also affordability factors that are playing into this. And yes, there was a bit of enthusiasm in the market that interest rates were going to be moving down.
A number of times, as we went through 2024, some of that enthusiasm has subsided. What I love about our program is that our program cuts through the middle. What I don't see is another ramp-up in interest rates, but, you know, anything can happen. But inflation hasn't yet revealed itself as fully under control.
And I don't feel like the Fed has built up that confidence yet that says we're ready to start moving interest rates. And our program enables us to succeed quite well if interest rates move down. In fact, we're really levered to the fact that if interest rates move down, our margins should do quite well. But to the extent that interest rates basically stay the same or migrate upward a little bit, we're still pushing volume, pushing focus on rationalizing expenses or the cost of building homes, together with maximizing price and minimizing incentives that actually have to be used in order to generate strong margins.
So, our view today stands exactly as it was three months ago, even though there was more enthusiasm at that time for rates going down. We feel pretty strongly that we're going to be able to accomplish the margin levels that we've talked about in the environment, regardless of how it moves forward. We have a lot of levers to pull, and I think that we're really connected to the market, and we're very focused on production. And I think that production means leverage of costs, whether it's SG&A or cost of production.
And I think that we're going to be able to produce our margin. Jon, anything?
Jon Jaffe -- President and Co-Chief Executive Officer
I think you covered it. As we said, we continue to refine our ability to focus on the right price per home, which we feel confident will allow us to become even better at those communities and markets where we can pull back on incentives even more. And we'll continue to refine that, and I think that informs our confidence in what we see for the rest of the year.
Alan Ratner -- Zelman and Associates -- Analyst
Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.
Stuart Miller -- Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer
You bet.

The next question comes from Stephen Kim with Evercore. Your line is open.
Stephen Kim -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Yeah. Thanks very much, guys. Appreciate all the color. I had a little bit of difficulty catching all your comments, so apologies if I'm repeating anything here.
But I believe, Stuart, you were discussing maybe a new iteration of Quarterra, maybe. I don't know if you're still calling it that. But this time, you talked about $4 billion worth of land, I think, being included in this entity. I just wanted to get some more color around that.
So, is it -- is that about a half years worth of land? How is that 4 billion different from what was initially conceived? I think you initially talked about 4 billion, but I believe most of those have now already been put into fund structures. So, you know, how -- what is this 4 billion in land and how is it different? And then is it including other maybe what not we might consider noncore assets as well? If you can just give us some more color on this new Quarterra?
Stuart Miller -- Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer
OK. So, first of all, I have PTSD going backwards and talking about the prior spin. So, I'm not going to use the Quarterra name right now. Is that OK with you, Steve?
Stephen Kim -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Totally fine.
Stuart Miller -- Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer
OK. Good. So, I'm not going to talk about this as a reincarnation of Quarterra because it isn't. With the prior spin, we were focused, number one, on a tax-free spin.
And number two, it was basically a multifamily, single-family for-rent assets that we were spinning into a different kind of operation. This is specifically taxable spin, straight down the fairway, land that is basically under production that is, you know, regular operating land. It is not, you know, excess or ancillary property or anything like that. It should be cash-flowing immediately.
And it is just a straightforward spin of a land program that dovetails extremely well with what we already have in place. Relative to other land banking programs, this enables us to build yet another vertical that will be complementary to the others that we have, but it gives us a broader range of feeders that enable us to fortify the durability of our land-light strategy. And that's been our focus, is how do we make sure and ensure that the market conditions we have today are market conditions that we can depend on in the future. Yes, we have land developers.
Yes, we have land sellers that we auction land from. But we also have the added benefit of land banking structures, and we're creating another and unique land banking structure with a permanent capital vehicle attribute that enables us to create that durability, that confidence that as we go forward, just like with lumber, just like with appliances, land becomes more of a commodity that we take down just in time.
Stephen Kim -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
That's really helpful. I appreciate the distinction there. How about these other assets which were initially conceived to be in this -- the entity previously been called Quarterra, are there any plans for that?
Stuart Miller -- Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think it's widely known that relative to our first fund of multifamily, where we do have some investment, that is currently under discussion as to how it will -- it has come to the end of its fund life and we're considering either a sale or some kind of extension program or something. Those assets will, over time, burn off. The new focus on multifamily is to be building in a more distinctly private equity-based program where we become much more of a production engine for more affordable product. The products that we were building historically kind of fallen out of favor given interest rate changes.
And yet, affordable rental product is very desirable and something that we can produce much more comfortably within the Lennar homebuilding division. And so, it will be much more of a production merchant build kind of program, spinning regularly, just like the rest of our product.
Stephen Kim -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
OK. Gotcha. That's helpful. Thanks very much for that.
The second question I had is, I think, earlier, you were discussing in your prepared remarks the cash that you have on your balance sheet, you know, 5 billion, and I think you acknowledged that there was some interest in seeing how you were going to deploy that. And I believe you talked about that -- your response to that was that talked about a strengthening of your relationship with your land partners, how that evolved, how would it have been tested, you know, over the last year and a half. And you have come through that now to a -- you know, at a place where you have now a more -- much more robust relationship battle-tested with your partners. And so, it seemed to me that you were suggesting that the excess cash that you are holding maybe no longer serve the purpose that it once did.
I want to make sure that I am paraphrasing what you were -- was saying correctly. And then -- and if so, it sort of still leaves open the question of is there anything else that you might be waiting for -- you know, that you want to be patient about to see before maybe deploying that cash?
Stuart Miller -- Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer
You know, look, we've been unapologetic about being patient. As we've migrated to a land-light strategy, we've wanted to be patient about recognizing that we are developing new sources of land relationships. We want to make sure that as the market ebbs and flows, that what became -- what we depended on didn't evaporate, and then all of a sudden, we needed to have capital to be able to grow, to be able to produce. I think we've gained a tremendous amount of confidence in the structures that we've built.
We're continuing to gain that confidence. We're looking to build more of those structures in order to have that durability baked in. So, that we -- you know, we're much -- we're very comfortable holding a stronger balance sheet to just make sure that as we go forward, we continue to grow forward and have the capacity to do that. I think, as we've gained confidence, the need for holding that cash becomes less and less important.
I think that our $5 billion share repurchase authorization is an indicator that we're leaning more into returning capital to shareholders, along with our dividend. And it's all in stepping stones. We're not afraid to go slower rather than to go fast. But the fact of the matter is we don't have something else out there that we're looking at that we're anticipating using cash for.
It is simply safety stock, so to speak, to make sure that the plumbing system we put in place is durable for the future, and we'll continue to make sure that we're positioned for the future. And as we get that confidence, you can expect that we'll be buying back more stock, and that's where the allocation of capital is going to go. It's not going to go to something else that's unanticipated right now.
Stephen Kim -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Great. Thanks so much, guys.
Stuart Miller -- Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer
OK. Thank you.

The next question comes from Mike Rehaut with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
Mike Rehaut -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Thanks. Good morning, everyone, or just about this afternoon. I appreciate all the detail and colors, as always. Two questions.
First, a little bit more, obviously, on the -- on this proposed land spin. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about it correctly because initially, I think to Steve's prior question, you know, it kind of hit on different areas of your current land program or, you know, prior iterations of how you're thinking about, you know, moving different assets on or off the balance sheet. So, it kind of sounds like this might be more of a -- when you talk about a spin and a new or separate vehicle, my mind is kind of moving a little bit toward the Forestar type of relationship of -- that they have with D.R. Horton and the fact that, you know, there's a lot of land that is on the Forestar, you know, entity that is -- you know, has a lot of rights of first refusal, etc.
to Horton, as opposed to, you know, something that I thought was more the direction when you started talking about this, which was kind of more moving land toward your existing land banking or land bankers relationships, you know, primarily, you know, thinking about the large facility that you have with Angelo Gordon. So, I just want to make sure that I'm thinking about it correctly in terms of it being more the former than the latter. And, you know, in thinking about that 4 billion number, I mean, right now, you know, in your press release, you have about 4.5 billion of -- or 4.7 billion of land and land under development. You know, so 4 billion would be a huge number, a huge percentage of that amount.
Just want to make sure that I'm understanding that that 4 billion is coming out of that bucket and that would, in effect, represent, you know, over 80% of your, you know, lots owned that are on your balance sheet today.
Stuart Miller -- Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer
So, Mike, I recognize your thirst for more detail, and we'll give you more detail as we refine our programs. And I wouldn't be thinking about it through the lens of Forestar. We're probably not going to go in that direction. But we recognize that you would like to know more, and we'll give you greater detail as we refine the program.
Diane Bessette -- Chief Financial Officer
Mike, the only thing I would add, because that you might have been alluding to it, is that, you know, this will be structured so there won't be any consolidation on our balance sheet. It would be true -- a true spin of land that's in a separate entity, so we wouldn't have any of those complexities of consolidation.
Mike Rehaut -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
OK. So -- but just on that point, you know, if you're talking about a 4 billion type of number, it would appear that that represents the -- you know, again over 80% of the land and land under development. So, we're talking about, in effect, the majority of your land holdings. Is that the right way to think about it?
Stuart Miller -- Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer
We have been moving to a land-light strategy. That would be correct.
Mike Rehaut -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
OK. Secondly, on the gross margin front, you know, it was asked earlier about, you know, back half of the year, and it seems like to get to the guidance of roughly, you know, flat year over year for the full year, you're looking at, you know, back half gross margins of roughly 24% on average. You know, we talked about, you know, maybe the mortgage market being, you know, perhaps less potentially of a downward slope throughout the year than was initially anticipated. What is necessary to hit that 24% in the back half? Is it, you know, kind of already, I would assume, on the books from a land cost basis, construction cost basis, or are there -- do you need to have, you know, less costly incentives or better pricing because, you know, at this point, to the extent that that doesn't come through, it seemed like, you know, the only way to hit that 24%, if it was much more of just a mix and what's coming through the pipe, so to speak?
Stuart Miller -- Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer
So, as we detailed, our focus and programming has been really carefully crafted by design to focus on using our production programs to bring down costs and to use our machine to focus on right pricing, whether it's price increases as the market gives them or whether it's the very carefully crafted use of incentives. So, the first thing is cost reconciliation, together with, you know, proper pricing. We feel comfortable that we're going to be able to migrate in that direction. The second part of it is leverage.
As we go through the year, we're generally producing and delivering more homes. So, there's some embedded leverage in that. And so, there are a lot of moving parts that make up our view of where our margin is likely to go. Of course, market conditions can change.
They can change to the positive and to the negative. And we've been very clear that margin is somewhat of a springboard for maintaining the volume that we expected to maintain. So, there will be elements of the economic environment that factor into it as well. Can I detail specifically what the relationships are in those numbers? I don't think so right now.
But it's a combination of all of those pieces that will drive our margins to where we expect them to be for the year. We do have some visibility in some of the sales that have come through, and we continue to have confidence that we're going to be able to get to that number -- to those numbers by the end of the year.
Jon Jaffe -- President and Co-Chief Executive Officer
And I think, as we said earlier, assuming interest rates stay relatively flat with where they are, we think we can continue to improve our operational view of how to increase margins in that same interest rate environment.
Mike Rehaut -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Great. Thanks so much.
Stuart Miller -- Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer
OK. You bet.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Kenneth Zener with Seaport Research Partners. Your line is open.
Ken Zener -- Seaport Research Partners -- Analyst
Good morning, everybody, or afternoon now. Want to start kind of high level here to understand or for you to clarify, perhaps, even flow where starts lead orders, which is less cyclical. So, first high-level question is what is your start capacity based on kind of your land partners, right? There are some type of guardrails we have there, and one of the big focuses of the industry is, are you going to grow or return, in general? And on the land spin, why are you guys choosing to introduce this vehicle versus building out the homes or see knowing it as you have been doing back already I guess?
Stuart Miller -- Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, first question first. Production is clearly derived from how many homesites we have available. I think that we have mapped out what we think the production can be given the homesites that we have coming through the system.
And we would expect that what you are seeing as a production schedule is very well baked into both the land availability and its cycle of becoming developed homesites. So, you know, think about the way that you're seeing production put in place to get to that, let's call it, 80,000 delivery number, plus some, you know, overage for what falls into the next year, that that's already baked into what the starts pace will be, as I highlighted, with about 21,000 starts this quarter. We have, of course, excellent visibility as to the homesites that are coming through the system for that and likewise into the next quarters as well. Jon, did you want to add something to that?
Jon Jaffe -- President and Co-Chief Executive Officer
Relative to this first question, the -- as land goes into our land banking relationships, it goes into it with a takedown schedule that matches what Stuart just described. So, there are no guardrails that limit our ability to execute on the planned volume.
Stuart Miller -- Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer
So then, as it relates to your second question, we've been very focused on building, you know, multiple sources of capital for our optioning and land banking programs. Actually, building a permanent capital vehicle rather than being completely reliant on private equity capital constantly coming into a program, we thought, was a greater good and a big benefit. So, when you ask the question, why go in a different direction when some of the tried and true directions so far are viable as well? They are viable, and we continue to lean into those programs. This is an and rather than an or.
This, to us, is building that durability, that confidence that the capital will be there even as the market ebbs and flows going forward. And so, that's why we're choosing to build this way rather than just drive, as we have, by putting -- you know, taking land from balance sheet, building, see knowing, all of that. This is a cleaner way to build a permanent capital vehicle that's durable for the future.
Ken Zener -- Seaport Research Partners -- Analyst
OK. Appreciate that because I -- that's good. My second question is about margin communication, which is one of the factors affecting, you know, investors today. So, margins and your forecast for second half, nobody knows the future, right, and you're trying to help us.
But I think everything you've been talking about even flow is much more important to your capital allocation and the true returns of your company as you go asset-light. So, do you see -- and I think we all can model what that free cash flow will be within a range. Do you see -- when you get to that comfort level where, you know, land is neutralized, therefore net income equals cash flow, do you guys see yourself systematically buying back stock in line with net income, or do you -- you know, when we get to that point, or are you guys going to try to time it? Obviously, with NVR, we see that they've run up a lot of cash. So, do you guys -- are you hoping to have essentially buybacks match net income systemically when you're there, or is there something else we should know about your thinking when that time arrives? Thank you.
Stuart Miller -- Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer
No, I think that, generally speaking, I think we're migrating to a more orderly buyback program. We've been conservative in our buyback program, as I've noted, to make sure that the systems that we put in place are durable for our future. So, that conservatism shouldn't confuse. You know, as we look ahead, we don't have a thought process around a different use of cash.
In fact, we're growing into the cash flow model that we've created. And as we find that it is more durable and sustainable and we test kind of the edges, you can kind of expect that the cash flow generating is basically going to go right back into stock buyback.
Diane Bessette -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Ken, I think what I would add is, as you know, previously, we prioritized debt repayment over that. But after we make this April payment, we'll only have $2 billion of notes outstanding, and it's, you know, one in '25, one in '26. And I think the other is in '27.
So, you know, we don't have that priority to focus on anymore. So, you know, I think Stuart's point is an important one that stock buyback really does become the priority because I think we've done a nice job of deleveraging the balance sheet from a debt standpoint.
Ken Zener -- Seaport Research Partners -- Analyst
Agree and thank you very much.
Stuart Miller -- Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer
Very good. And why don't we go to our last question now?
Operator
Thank you. That last question is from John Lovallo with UBS. Your line is open.
John Lovallo -- UBS -- Analyst
Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my questions as well. I mean, I guess, the first one, just going back to the spin for a moment. I mean, if the purpose here is to sort of guarantee capital for Lennar to grow and sort of guarantee land banking, even if private equity pulls back, I mean, it would seem that the spin would need to be very well financed, strong balance sheet.
How much cash do you envision the spin needing?
Stuart Miller -- Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer
Probably not very much. I think that the assets, as they're configured or as we're thinking about it, should be cash-flowing pretty readily. And therefore, the spin will actually spend cash and, you know, bring in the cash and redeploy and should work well on its own.
John Lovallo -- UBS -- Analyst
OK. Understood. And then maybe just zeroing in on the second quarter gross margin outlook, which is up about 70 basis points sequentially at the midpoint, can you just walk us through some of the moving pieces there in terms of fixed cost leverage, net price, cost -- incremental cost inflation, and things of that nature?
Diane Bessette -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, I think that -- I'm going to walk through it more in detail, but I think that, you know, if you look at the second quarter of last year, it's very comparable. So, you can see the leverage pickup, particularly in field expenses. You know, just in order of magnitude, you know, you kind of get a lot of pickup just from that perspective.
So, that's certainly helpful. And, you know, I don't know that there's anything more to say on that. I think we've talked about controlling incentives, selling the right homes. But part of the credibility should be just the operating leverage that we're going to get, in addition to the other things that we spoke about.
John Lovallo -- UBS -- Analyst
OK. Thank you.
Stuart Miller -- Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer
OK. Well, that wraps it up for this quarter. I thank everybody for joining us. Proud of the quarter that we put forth.
We look forward to reporting more progress as we go forward. Thanks for your time, and we'll get to you next quarter.
